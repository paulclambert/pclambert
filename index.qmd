# About me

I am a biostatistician working at the [Cancer Registry of Norway (Kreftregisteret)](https://www.kreftregisteret.no/). 
I also work part-time as a Guest Professor of Biostatistics in the [Biostatistics Group](https://ki.se/en/meb/research/meb-biostatistics-group) in the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Previously, I worked as a Professor of Biostatistics at the [Biostatistics Research Group](https://le.ac.uk/biostatistics/biostatistics-research-group) at the University of Leicester, UK.

I have a variety of interests, mainly in the area of survival analysis in epidemiology. Much of my work focuses on the analysis from data from national cancer registries. I particularly enjoy writing [software](software.qmd) (mainly in Stata) to enable transferal of new methods into practice.

My teaching is now mainly in specialist [courses](courses.qmd). I have developed some [interactive graphs](interactive_graphs.qmd) to help with communication.
