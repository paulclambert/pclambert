You can [download the datasets and code](https://www.stata-press.com/data/fpsaus.html) used in the book.

A review of the book can be found [here](https://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=gn0057).

We are writing a second edition of the book with [Mark Rutherford](https://le.ac.uk/people/mark-rutherford) included as an additional author.
