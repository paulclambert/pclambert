  abstract    = {The concept of frailty plays a major role in the statistical field
	of survival analysis. Frailty variation refers to differences in
	risk between individuals which go beyond known or measured risk factors.
	In other words, frailty variation is unobserved heterogeneity. Although
	understanding frailty is of interest in its own right, the literature
	on survival analysis has demonstrated that existence of frailty variation
	can lead to surprising artefacts in statistical estimation that are
	important to examine. We present literature that demonstrates the
	presence and significance of frailty variation between individuals.
	We discuss the practical content of frailty variation, and show the
	link between frailty and biological concepts like (epi)genetics and
	heterogeneity in disease risk. There are numerous suggestions in
	the literature that a good deal of this variation may be due to randomness,
	in addition to genetic and/or environmental factors. Heterogeneity
	often manifests itself as clustering of cases in families more than
	would be expected by chance. We emphasize that apparently moderate
	familial relative risks can only be explained by strong underlying
	variation in disease risk between families and individuals. Finally,
	we highlight the potential impact of frailty variation in the interpretation
	of standard epidemiological measures such as hazard and incidence
	rates.},

  abstract    = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the number of deaths among cancer patients
	diagnosed in Great Britain that would be avoidable within 5 years
	of diagnosis if the mean (or highest) survival in Europe for patients
	diagnosed during 1985-1989, 1990-1994 and 1995-1999 were achieved.
	DESIGN: Five-year relative survival for cancers in Great Britain
	compared with that from other countries in the EUROCARE-2, -3 and
	-4 studies. Calculation of excess deaths (those more than expected
	from mortality in the general population) that would be avoidable
	among cancer patients in Britain if relative survival were the same
	as in Europe. SETTING: Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland) and
	13 other European countries. SUBJECTS: 2.8 million adults diagnosed
	in Britain with 1 of 39 cancers during 1985-1989 (followed up to
	1994), 1990-1994 (followed up to 1999) and 1995-1999 (followed up
	to 2003). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Annual number of avoidable deaths
	within 5 years of diagnosis. Percentage of the excess (cancer-related)
	deaths among cancer patients that would be avoidable. RESULTS: Compared
	with the mean European 5-year relative survival, the largest numbers
	of avoidable deaths for patients diagnosed during 1985-1989 were
	for cancers of the breast (about 18\% of the excess mortality from
	this cancer, 7541 deaths), prostate (14\%, 4285), colon (9\%, 4090),
	stomach (8\%, 3483) and lung (2\%, 3548). For 1990-1994, the largest
	numbers of avoidable deaths were for cancers of the prostate (20\%,
	7335), breast (15\%, 6165), colon (9\%, 4376), stomach (9\%, 3672),
	lung (2\%, 3735) and kidney (22\%, 2644). For 1995-1999, most of
	the avoidable deaths were for cancers of the prostate (17\%, 5758),
	breast (15\%, 5475), lung (3\%, 4923), colon (10\%, 4295), stomach
	(9\%, 3137) and kidney (21\%, 2686).Overall, some 6600-7500 premature
	deaths would have been avoided each year among cancer patients diagnosed
	in Britain during 1985-1999 if the mean survival in Europe had been
	achieved. This represents 6-7\% of cancer-related mortality. Compared
	with the highest European survival, avoidable premature mortality
	among cancer patients fell from about 12 800 deaths a year (12.2\%
	of cancer-related mortality) to about 11 400 deaths a year (10.6\%)
	over the same period.A large component of the avoidable mortality
	is due to prostate cancer: excluding this cancer from comparison
	with the European mean survival reduces the annual number of avoidable
	deaths by 1000-1500, and the percentage of excess mortality by up
	to 1\%. Compared with the highest survival, the annual number of
	avoidable deaths would be 1500-2000 fewer, and 1-2\% lower as a percentage
	of excess mortality, but the overall trend in avoidable premature
	mortality among cancer patients would be similar, falling from 11.4\%
	(1985-1989) to 10.3\% (1990-1994) and 9.7\% for those diagnosed during
	1995-1999.For several cancers, survival in Britain was slightly higher
	than the mean survival in Europe; this represented some 110-180 premature
	deaths avoided each year during the period 1985-2003. CONCLUSIONS:
	Avoidable premature mortality among cancer patients diagnosed in
	Britain during 1985-1999 has represented 6-7\% of cancer-related
	mortality compared with the mean survival in Europe. Compared with
	the highest levels of survival in Europe, the reduction from 12.2\%
	to 10.6\% of cancer-related mortality reflects small but steady progress
	over the period 1985-2003.},

	typically considered independently of each other. We propose the
	product model, lambda(t;x) = lambda(0)(t)exp[beta(t)r(x)] which allows
	for joint estimation of both effects, and investigate its properties.
	The functions describing the time-dependent beta(t) and non-linear
	r(x) effects are modelled simultaneously using regression splines
	and estimated by maximum partial likelihood. Likelihood ratio tests
	are proposed to compare alternative models. Simulations indicate
	that both the recovery of the shapes of the two functions and the
	size of the tests are reasonably accurate provided they are based
	on the correct model. By contrast, type I error rates may be highly
	inflated, and the estimates considerably biased, if the model is
	misspecified. Applications in cancer epidemiology illustrate how
	the product model may yield new insights about the role of prognostic
	factors.},

	the former difficulty may be overcome, at least to a limited extent,
	by the use of standardized effects, the latter is often more problematic.
	Two potential solutions to this problem are; sensitivity analyses
	and a fully Bayesian approach, in which pertinent external information
	is included. Both approaches are illustrated using the results of
	two systematic reviews and meta-analyses which consider the difference
	in mean change in systolic blood pressure and the difference in physical
	functioning between an intervention and control group. The two examples
	illustrate that by adopting a fully Bayesian approach, as opposed
	to undertaking sensitivity analyses assuming fixed values for unknown
	parameters, the overall intervention effect can be estimated with
	greater uncertainty, but that assessing the sensitivity of results
	to choice of prior distributions in such analyses is crucial.},

	bacteria. Their unique outer membrane (OM) provides them with a hydrophilic
	surface structure, which makes them inherently resistant to many
	antimicrobial agents, thus hindering their control. However, with
	permeabilizers, compounds that disintegrate and weaken the OM, Gram-negative
	cells can be sensitized to several external agents. Although antimicrobial
	activity of plant-derived phenolic compounds has been widely reported,
	their mechanisms of action have not yet been well demonstrated. The
	aim of our study was to elucidate the role of selected colonic microbial
	metabolites of berry-derived phenolic compounds in the weakening
	of the Gram-negative OM. The effect of the agents on the OM permeability
	of Salmonella was studied utilizing a fluorescence probe uptake assay,
	sensitization to hydrophobic antibiotics, and lipopolysaccharide
	(LPS) release. Our results show that 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid,
	3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid
	(3,4-diHPP), 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, 3-phenylpropionic

	and S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis as indicated by
	an increase in the uptake of the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine
	(NPN). The OM-destabilizing activity of the compounds was partially
	abolished by MgCl2 addition, indicating that part of their activity
	is based on removal of OM-stabilizing divalent cations. Furthermore,
	3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-diHPP
	increased the susceptibility of S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar
	Typhimurium strains for novobiocin. In addition, organic acids present
	in berries, such as malic acid, sorbic acid, and benzoic acid, were
	shown to be efficient permeabilizers of Salmonella as shown by an

	The first worldwide study (CONCORD) found wide international differences

	diagnostic procedures, treatment and follow-up were collected for
	about 20,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer aged 15-99 years
	during 1996-98 in 7 US states and 12 European countries. Age-standardized
	net survival and the excess hazard of death up to 5 years after diagnosis
	were estimated by jurisdiction (registry, country, European region),
	age and stage with flexible parametric models. Breast cancers were
	generally less advanced in the US than in Europe. Stage also varied
	less between US states than between European jurisdictions. Early,
	node-negative tumors were more frequent in the US (39\%) than in
	Europe (32\%), while locally advanced tumors were twice as frequent
	in Europe (8\%), and metastatic tumors of similar frequency (5-6\%).
	Net survival in Northern, Western and Southern Europe (81-84\%) was
	similar to that in the US (84\%), but lower in Eastern Europe (69\%).
	For the first 3 years after diagnosis the mean excess hazard was
	higher in Eastern Europe than elsewhere: the difference was most
	marked for women aged 70-99 years, and mainly confined to women with
	locally advanced or metastatic tumors. Differences in breast cancer
	survival between Europe and the US in the late 1990s were mainly
	explained by lower survival in Eastern Europe, where low healthcare
	expenditure may have constrained the quality of treatment.},

	the last 10-15 years. However, there has been no published review
	of the use and presentation of survival analyses. We have carried
	out a systematic review of the research papers published between
	October and December 1991 in five clinical oncology journals. A total
	of 132 papers were reviewed. We looked at several aspects of study
	design, data handling, analysis and presentation of the results.
	We found that almost half of the papers did not give any summary
	of length of follow-up; that in 62\% of papers at least one end point
	was not clearly defined; and that both logrank and multivariate analyses
	were frequently reported at most only as P-values [63/84 (75\%) and
	22/47 (47\%) respectively]. Furthermore, although many studies were
	small, uncertainty of the estimates was rarely indicated [in 13/84
	(15\%) logrank and 16/47 (34\%) multivariate results]. The procedure
	for categorisation of continuous variables in logrank analyses was
	explained in only 8/49 (16\%) papers. The quality of graphs was felt
	to be poor in 43/117 (37\%) papers which included at least one survival
	curve. To address some of the presentational inadequacies found in
	this review we include new suggested guidelines for the presentation
	of survival analyses in medical journals. These would complement
	the statistical guidelines recommended by several clinical oncology
	journals.},

	a family history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery

  abstract    = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: When the mortality among a cancer patient group
	returns to the same level as in the general population, that is,
	the patients no longer experience excess mortality, the patients
	still alive are considered "statistically cured". Cure models can
	be used to estimate the cure proportion as well as the survival function
	of the "uncured". One limitation of parametric cure models is that
	the functional form of the survival of the "uncured" has to be specified.
	It can sometimes be hard to find a survival function flexible enough
	to fit the observed data, for example, when there is high excess
	hazard within a few months from diagnosis, which is common among
	older age groups. This has led to the exclusion of older age groups
	in population-based cancer studies using cure models. METHODS: Here
	we have extended the flexible parametric survival model to incorporate
	cure as a special case to estimate the cure proportion and the survival
	of the "uncured". Flexible parametric survival models use splines
	to model the underlying hazard function, and therefore no parametric
	distribution has to be specified. RESULTS: We have compared the fit
	from standard cure models to our flexible cure model, using data
	on colon cancer patients in Finland. This new method gives similar
	results to a standard cure model, when it is reliable, and better
	fit when the standard cure model gives biased estimates. CONCLUSIONS:
	Cure models within the framework of flexible parametric models enables
	cure modelling when standard models give biased estimates. These
	flexible cure models enable inclusion of older age groups and can
	give stage-specific estimates, which is not always possible from
	parametric cure models.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of survival for
	colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), and to investigate the prognostic
	factors for the disease. In the analysis, 50993 cases of CRC aged
	40-84 years, diagnosed between 1958 and 1997 in Norway, were included.
	Esteve's relative survival method was used, together with a time
	trend analysis, conducted by least-squares linear regression. Cox
	proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine cause-specific
	mortality. Five-year relative CRC survival has increased by an estimated
	3\% per 5-year diagnostic period. In 1958-1962, relative survival
	was about 40\% for both males and females, and increased to 56 and
	60\%, respectively, in 1993-1997. Rectal cancer had a higher cause-specific
	mortality (RR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.22-1.30) than proximal colon (reference)
	and distal colon (RR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.93-1.00 cancers), while females
	had a lower cause-specific mortality than males (RR 0.88, 95\% CI
	0.86-0.90). The increase in the relative survival rate in Norway
	is probably due to improved treatments and advanced diagnostics.
	Norway has a higher CRC survival rate than the EUROCARE average.},

	was to evaluate the antitumour efficacy of somatostatin analogues
	in patients with documented progressive tumours. 35 consecutive patients
	with documented tumour progression were treated with somatostatin
	analogues. Patients were classified into two groups. In Group 1,
	tumours were progressing rapidly (an increase of 50\% or more in
	the lesion surface area in 3 months) and in Group 2, tumours were
	progressing more slowly (an increase of less than 50\% in the lesion
	surface area in 3 months but greater than 25\% in 6 months). Treatment
	consisted of subcutaneous (s.c.) octreotide, 100 microg thrice daily
	for 17 patients, intramuscular lanreotide, 30 mg/every 14 days for
	11 patients and for 7 patients both somatostatin analogues were used
	successively during the follow-up. Primary tumour sites were the
	small intestine (n=12), pancreas (n=13), lungs (n=5), and other sites
	(n=5). 18 patients had the carcinoid syndrome with flushing and/or
	diarrhoea. The median duration of treatment was 7 months. Treatment
	was discontinued in 3 patients due to side-effects. One patient (3\%)
	achieved a partial response and the disease was stabilised in 20
	patients (57\%) for a median duration of 11 months (6-48 months).
	Stabilisation of patients in Group 1 was significantly less frequent
	at 6 months than that of patients in Group 2 (4/12 and 13/17 respectively,
	P<0.02). Somatostatin analogue treatment resulted in one partial
	response (3\%) and 20 cases of stabilisation (57\%) in 35 patients
	with progressive NET. A slow tumour growth rate before treatment
	is predictive of a good response to somatostatin analogues which
	could be considered an option for first-line treatment.},

	MO2 with time during development (delta MO2/delta t = 21.5 mumols/h2;

	precision at the cost of increased vulnerability to bias. To further

	might share a common cause and, therefore, relatives of patients
	with IBD could be at increased risk of this malignant disease. We
	aimed to assess cancer rates among first-degree relatives of patients

	diseases exists. METHODS: In a population-based study, we identified
	114,102 first-degree relatives by registry linkage and followed them
	up for cancer occurrence. We used standardised incidence ratio (SIR)
	of cancer as relative risk. FINDINGS: 560 colorectal cancers were
	identified among relatives. First-degree relatives of patients with
	Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were not at increased risk
	of cancer (SIR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.82-0.97). The relative risk was 0.96
	(0.87-1.06, n=379) for colon cancer and 0.78 (0.68-0.91, 181) for
	rectal cancer. The SIRs were not affected by age, relation to patient,
	or type or extent of IBD in the patient. Relatives of patients with
	both IBD and colorectal cancer had an 80\% increased risk of colorectal
	cancer. INTERPRETATION: Our results do not endorse a common cause
	of IBD and colorectal cancer. The slightly decreased relative risk
	for colorectal cancer among relatives could indicate the proportion
	of all colorectal cancer cases attributable to IBD.},

  abstract    = {The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the mode of discovery
	of breast cancer in the last 15 years. We compared two periods separated
	by a 10-year interval, during which a mass mammographic screening
	programme was established in our department.We made a retrospective
	comparison of the records of female patients with breast cancer diagnosed
	in our hospital over the period 1986-1989 (first period) and 1997-1999
	(second period). The mass screening programme for breast cancer began
	in 1995.We collected 372 patients in the first period and 341 in
	the second. We found a significant change in the mode of the discovery
	of breast cancer between the two periods: 80.2\% versus 51.9\%, respectively,
	of the cases of breast cancer were discovered by breast self-examination,
	10.2\% versus 13.7\% were discovered by a physician, and 4.8\% versus
	29.1\% were discovered by routine mammography as part of an individual
	or mass screening programme. The mean size of the tumours decreased
	significantly (2.6 cm versus 2.3 cm: p = 0.019), and the number of
	tumours with initial metastases or lymph node involvement decreased,
	almost attaining the level of significance (p = 0.06). It is difficult
	to compare the survival and disease-free survival curves because
	of the short follow-up in the second period (median follow-up = 10
	months). However, a marked difference appears to be developing (p
	< 0.0001): patients diagnosed by mammography are showing better survival
	and disease-free survival compared with the others.We observed that
	more widespread use of mammography screening for breast cancer led
	to smaller tumours being discovered during the second period, with
	less lymph node involvement and less initial metastasis. Breast cancer
	screening is one of the most intensively evaluated health care practices
	with eight completed randomized trials yet its net benefit has remained
	controversial. It has been shown that, at least for patients aged
	50 to 70, properly organized mass screening for breast cancer led
	to a reduction in mortality rate. However, individual breast self-exam,
	physician and mammographic screening can interfere with assessment
	of mass screening programmes in terms of individual benefit. In addition,
	introducing a mass screening programme may induce opportunistic screening
	in non-invited age groups and influence health behaviour in the target
	and non target populations. A retrospective study was performed to
	evaluate the mode of discovery, the diagnostic presentation, and
	prognostic factors in breast cancer in a French department before
	and after initiation of a mass-screening programme (MSP).},

	We have made gene-targeted mice that express a hypomorphic mutant

	homozygous mutant mice develop a vascular defect and up-regulate
	an immediate early gene implicated in vascular disease, egr-1. They

	of chyle in the thoracic cage (chylothorax). The mice have dilated
	lymphatic vessels (lymphangiectasis) as early as E16.5. Interestingly,
	they express more egr-1 in heart and pulmonary arteries at E18.5.
	Net negatively regulates the egr-1 promoter and binds specifically
	to SRE-5. Egr-1 has been associated with pathologies involving vascular
	stenosis (e.g. atherosclerosis), and here egr-1 dysfunction could
	possibly be associated with obstructions that ultimately affect the

	using joinpoint regression models. RESULTS: Significant reductions
	in prostate-cancer mortality were observed in United Kingdom, United

	and downward trends were also observable in the Netherlands, Ireland
	and {S}weden. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality declines for prostate cancer
	are now evident in 12 out of the 24 developed countries considered
	in this analysis. Increases in PSA screening and better treatment
	of early-stage disease, possibly acting in combination, remain plausible
	hypotheses.},

	this inequality has changed over time and what this means in terms
	of the impact a cancer diagnosis has on Indigenous people. Survival
	information for all patients identified as either Indigenous (n=3168)
	or non-Indigenous (n=211,615) and diagnosed in Queensland between
	1997 and 2012 were obtained from the Queensland Cancer Registry,
	with mortality followed up to 31st December, 2013. Flexible parametric
	survival models were used to quantify changes in the cause-specific
	survival inequalities and the number of lives that might be saved
	if these inequalities were removed. Among Indigenous cancer patients,
	the 5-year cause-specific survival (adjusted by age, sex and broad
	cancer type) increased from 52.9\% in 1997-2006 to 58.6\% in 2007-2012,
	while it improved from 61.0\% to 64.9\% among non-Indigenous patients.
	This meant that the adjusted 5-year comparative survival ratio (Indigenous:
	non-Indigenous) increased from 0.87 [0.83-0.88] to 0.89 [0.87-0.93],
	with similar improvements in the 1-year comparative survival. Using
	a simulated cohort corresponding to the number and age-distribution
	of Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer in Queensland each year
	(n=300), based on the 1997-2006 cohort mortality rates, 35 of the
	170 deaths due to cancer (21\%) expected within five years of diagnosis
	were due to the Indigenous: non-Indigenous survival inequality. This
	percentage was similar when applying 2007-2012 cohort mortality rates
	(19\%; 27 out of 140 deaths). Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer
	still face a poorer survival outlook than their non-Indigenous counterparts,
	particularly in the first year after diagnosis. The improving survival
	outcomes among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cancer patients,
	and the decreasing absolute impact of the Indigenous survival disadvantage,
	should provide increased motivation to continue and enhance current
	strategies to further reduce the impact of the survival inequalities
	faced by Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether the elevated risk of gastric
	cancer among patients with gastric ulcer (GU) and the enigmatic low
	risk among patients with duodenal ulcer (DU) pertain to both cardia
	and noncardia cancer. We also studied the risks among operated patients
	while taking the disparate baseline risks into consideration. METHODS:
	Retrospective cohorts of 59,550 and 79,412 unoperated patients with
	DU and GU, respectively, plus 12,840 patients with partial gastric
	resection and 8,105 with vagotomy, recorded in the Swedish Inpatient
	Register since 1970, were followed from the first hospitalization
	(date of operation for the surgery cohort) until occurrence of any
	cancer, death, emigration, definitive surgery, or December 31, 2003.
	Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95\% confidence intervals
	(CIs) expressed relative risk (RR), compared to the age-, sex-, and
	calendar period-matched Swedish population. Cox regression produced
	adjusted RR estimates among operated patients, relative to unoperated
	ones with the same ulcer type. RESULTS: While unoperated DU patients
	had a halved risk of noncardia cancer (SIR = 0.5, 95\% CI 0.4-0.7),
	their risk of cardia cancer was slightly above expectation (SIR =
	1.2, 95\% CI 0.8-1.7). Unoperated GU patients had doubled risks for
	both cancers (SIR = 2.1, 95\% CI 2.0-2.4 and SIR = 1.9, 95\% CI 1.4-2.3,
	respectively). DU patients who underwent gastric resection had a
	60\% risk elevation (RR = 1.6, 95\% CI 1.0-2.5) compared to unoperated
	ones. Vagotomy was associated with a greater risk in the first 10
	yr, but this excess disappeared with further follow-up. Resected
	GU patients had a 40\% risk reduction relative to their unoperated
	peers (RR = 0.6, 95\% CI 0.5-0.8). This reduction persisted well
	beyond the first postoperative decade. CONCLUSION: The DU-related
	protection against gastric cancer does not seem to pertain to cardia
	cancer. With gastric resection, risks are shifted toward normality,
	regardless of underlying ulcer type.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Despite decades of basic and clinical research and trials
	of promising new therapies, cancer remains a major cause of morbidity
	and mortality. We assessed overall progress against cancer in the
	United States from 1970 through 1994 by analyzing changes in age-adjusted
	mortality rates. METHODS: We obtained from the National Center for
	Health Statistics data on all deaths from cancer and from cancer
	at specific sites, as well as on deaths due to cancer according to
	age, race, and sex, for the years 1970 through 1994. We computed
	age-specific mortality rates and adjusted them to the age distribution
	of the U.S. population in 1990. RESULTS: Age-adjusted mortality due
	to cancer in 1994 (200.9 per 100,000 population) was 6.0 percent
	higher than the rate in 1970 (189.6 per 100,000). After decades of
	steady increases, the age-adjusted mortality due to all malignant
	neoplasms plateaued, then decreased by 1.0 percent from 1991 to 1994.
	The decline in mortality due to cancer was greatest among black males
	and among persons under 55 years of age. Mortality among white males
	55 or older has also declined recently. These trends reflect a combination
	of changes in death rates from specific types of cancer, with important
	declines due to reduced cigarette smoking and improved screening
	and a mixture of increases and decreases in the incidence of types
	of cancer not closely related to tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS: The war
	against cancer is far from over. Observed changes in mortality due
	to cancer primarily reflect changing incidence or early detection.
	The effect of new treatments for cancer on mortality has been largely
	disappointing. The most promising approach to the control of cancer
	is a national commitment to prevention, with a concomitant rebalancing
	of the focus and funding of research.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The CONCORD study compares population-based relative survival
	from cancer using data from cancer registries in five continents.
	To estimate relative survival, general mortality life tables are
	required. Available statistics are incomplete, so various approaches
	are used to construct complete life tables. This article outlines
	how the life tables were constructed for CONCORD; it compares life
	expectancy at birth between 101 populations covered by cancer registries
	in 31 countries and compares the impact of two approaches to the
	deployment of life tables in relative survival analysis. METHODS:
	The CONCORD approach, using specific mathematical methods, produced
	complete (single-year-of-age) life tables by sex, cancer registry
	area, calendar year (1990-1999) and race (only in the USA). In order
	to study the impact of different approaches, we compared relative
	survival in the USA using the US national life table, centered on
	the relevant census years, and the CONCORD approach. We estimated
	relative survival in each American participating cancer registry
	for patients diagnosed with breast (women), colorectal or prostate
	cancer during 1990-1994 and followed up to 1999. RESULTS: Average
	life expectancy at birth during 1990-1999 varied in CONCORD cancer
	registry areas from 64 to 78 years in males and from 71 to 84 years
	in females. It increased during the 1990s more in men than in women.
	In the USA, it was lower in blacks than in whites. Relative survival
	in American populations was lower with the CONCORD approach, which
	incorporates trends and geographic variation in background mortality,
	than with the USA census life tables. CONCLUSIONS: International
	variation in background mortality by geographic area, calendar time,
	race, age and sex is wide. We suggest that in international comparisons
	of cancer relative survival, complete life tables that are specific

	and reliability of cancer registration are thus of great importance
	for all types of use of the cancer register. The aim of the study
	was to estimate the overall coverage of malignant cancer cases in
	1998 and to reveal possible reasons behind non-reporting.We selected
	all malignant cancer cases in the Hospital Discharge Register (HDR)
	from 1998 and compared these records to those reported to the SCR.
	There were 43,761 discharges for 42,010 individuals of whom 3,429
	individuals were not recorded in the SCR. From these 3 429 records
	we randomly selected 202 patients for review of their medical records
	to determine whether they should have been registered on the SCR
	as incident cases in 1998.About half of the 202 cases (93 malignant
	and 8 benign) should have been reported, which translates into an
	additional 1 579 malignant cases (95\% CI 1 349-1 808), or 3.7\%
	of the cases reported in 1998. The crude incidence rate for males
	and females combined would increase from 493 per 100,000 to 511 (95\%

	of the SCR is high and comparable to other high quality registers
	in Northern Europe. For most uses in epidemiological or public health
	surveillance, the underreporting will be without major impact. However,
	for specific research questions our findings have implications, as
	the degree of underreporting is site specific, increases with age,
	and does not seem to be random, as diagnoses without histology or
	cytology verification are overrepresented. An annual comparison of
	the SCR against the HDR could point to hospitals, geographic areas

	by logistic regression are frequent in the epidemiological literature.
	However, the odds ratio can importantly overestimate the prevalence
	ratio, the measure of choice in these studies. Also, controlling
	for confounding is not equivalent for the two measures. In this paper
	we explore alternatives for modeling data of such studies with techniques
	that directly estimate the prevalence ratio. METHODS: We compared
	Cox regression with constant time at risk, Poisson regression and
	log-binomial regression against the standard Mantel-Haenszel estimators.
	Models with robust variance estimators in Cox and Poisson regressions
	and variance corrected by the scale parameter in Poisson regression
	were also evaluated. RESULTS: Three outcomes, from a cross-sectional
	study carried out in Pelotas, Brazil, with different levels of prevalence
	were explored: weight-for-age deficit (4\%), asthma (31\%) and mother
	in a paid job (52\%). Unadjusted Cox/Poisson regression and Poisson
	regression with scale parameter adjusted by deviance performed worst
	in terms of interval estimates. Poisson regression with scale parameter
	adjusted by chi2 showed variable performance depending on the outcome
	prevalence. Cox/Poisson regression with robust variance, and log-binomial
	regression performed equally well when the model was correctly specified.
	CONCLUSIONS: Cox or Poisson regression with robust variance and log-binomial
	regression provide correct estimates and are a better alternative
	for the analysis of cross-sectional studies with binary outcomes
	than logistic regression, since the prevalence ratio is more interpretable
	and easier to communicate to non-specialists than the odds ratio.
	However, precautions are needed to avoid estimation problems in specific
	situations.},

	performed in 46 cases in contrast to 21 patients with non-resection

	Palliative resection surgery for primary colorectal cancer is associated
	with a higher median survival rate. Also, the presence of liver metastasis

	SETTING: A teaching maternity hospital and academic department of
	obstetrics and gynaecology. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty midwives, 20 nursing
	auxiliaries and nine laboratory technicians. RESULTS: For the two
	nonproteinuric solutions, a higher false positive rate was observed
	for nursing auxiliaries (40\% and 55\%), compared with midwives (5\%

	this paper, techniques to generate survival times for simulation
	studies regarding Cox proportional hazards models are presented.
	A general formula describing the relation between the hazard and
	the corresponding survival time of the Cox model is derived, which
	is useful in simulation studies. It is shown how the exponential,
	the Weibull and the Gompertz distribution can be applied to generate
	appropriate survival times for simulation studies. Additionally,
	the general relation between hazard and survival time can be used
	to develop own distributions for special situations and to handle
	flexibly parameterized proportional hazards models. The use of distributions
	other than the exponential distribution is indispensable to investigate
	the characteristics of the Cox proportional hazards model, especially
	in non-standard situations, where the partial likelihood depends
	on the baseline hazard. A simulation study investigating the effect

  abstract    = {The number needed to treat (NNT) is a popular summary statistic to
	describe the absolute effect of a new treatment compared with a standard
	treatment or control concerning the risk of an adverse event. The
	NNT concept can be applied whenever the risk of an adverse event
	is compared between two groups; for the comparison of exposed with
	unexposed subjects in epidemiological studies, we propose the term
	"number needed to be exposed" (NNE). Whereas in randomized clinical
	trials NNT can be calculated on the basis of a simple 2 x 2 table,
	in epidemiological studies methods to adjust for confounders are
	required in most applications. We derive a method based upon multiple
	logistic regression analysis to perform point and interval estimation
	of NNE with adjustment for confounding variables. The adjusted NNE
	can be calculated from the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the unexposed
	event rate (UER) estimated by means of an appropriate multiple logistic
	regression model. As UER is dependent on the confounders, the adjusted
	NNEs also vary with the values of the confounding variables. Two
	methods are proposed to take the dependence of NNE on the values
	of the confounders into account. The adjusted number needed to be
	exposed can be a useful complement to the commonly presented results
	in epidemiological studies, such as ORs and attributable risks.},

	time (NS) and their proportion among gastric cancers increased from
	3.4\% (1976-1980) to 7.9\% (1991-1995) (P < 0.01). Among these cancers,

	Lymph node metastases, location, sex and cancer extension and age
	were independent prognostic factors.Though it is on the increase,
	the proportion of early gastric cancers remains low among gastric
	cancers. This study confirms the importance of performing a gastroscopy

	whether stromal cells will further alter the properties of primitive
	progenitor cells exposed to cytokines. Single CD34(+)CD38(low) and
	CD38(neg) cells were incubated 10 days in serum-containing or serum-free
	medium in the presence or in the absence of murine marrow-derived
	stromal cells (MS-5). Recombinant human cytokines stem cell factor
	(SCF), pegylated-megakaryocyte growth and differentiation factor
	(PEG-MGDF), FLT3-L, Interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage
	colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were systematically added at various
	concentrations (10 to 300 ng/mL). Cell proliferation and LTC-IC potential
	were evaluated in each clone after 10 days. A striking and consistent
	observation was the retention of a high LTC-IC potential in clones
	exposed to cytokines in the presence of stromal feeders, whereas
	clones exposed to cytokines alone in the absence of stromal feeders
	rapidly lost their LTC-IC potential as they proliferated. This was
	reflected both by the higher proportion of wells containing LTC-IC
	and by the high numbers of CFC produced after 5 weeks in clones grown
	with MS-5 during the first 10 days. We further showed by analyzing
	multiple replicates of a single clone at day 10 that MS-5 cells promoted
	a net increase in the LTC-IC compartment through self-renewal divisions.
	Interestingly, these primitive LTC-IC were equally distributed among
	small and large clones, as counted at day 10, indicating that active
	proliferation and loss of LTC-IC potential could be dissociated.
	These observations show that, in primitive cells, stromal cells counteract
	differentiation events triggered by cytokines and promoted self-renewal
	divisions. Furthermore, the almost identical distribution of the
	size of the clones with or without MS-5 suggests that proliferation
	and function of human primitive cells may be independently regulated
	by external signals, and that the former is primarily under the control
	of cytokines.},

  abstract    = {The most popular model used for survival analysis is the proportional
	hazards regression model proposed by Cox. This is mainly due to its
	exceptional simplicity. Nevertheless the fundamental assumption of
	the Cox model is the proportionality of the hazards. For many applications,
	however, this assumption is doubtful. Proposals to extend the Cox
	model for non-proportional hazards to allow for dynamic effect structures
	usually either depend on prespecifications or require non-standard
	estimation techniques and are thus not favoured in application. Moreover,
	tests to verify the dynamic effect structures are not straightforward
	or lack omnibus power. In this paper we propose a flexible method
	for modelling dynamic effects in survival data within the Cox framework.
	The method is based on fractional polynomials as introduced by Royston
	and Altman. This allows for a transformation of the dynamic predictor
	which leads back to the conventional Cox model and hence fitting
	is straightforward using standard estimation techniques. In addition,
	it offers the possibility of easily verifying the existence of time-variation.
	We describe a model selection algorithm which selects time-varying
	effects only when evidence is given in the data. We illustrate the
	properties of the approach in a simulation study and compare it with
	other methods. In a survival study of gastric cancer patients, we
	apply the approach to analyse dynamic structures in the effects of
	prognostic factors.},

	in {S}weden, and 350 women without cervical cancer frequency matched
	for age and region of residence, provided information. Among the
	women with a history of cervical cancer and the control women, 46
	(18\%) and 50 (15\%), respectively, reported a history of sexual
	abuse. The follow-up was 1-70 years after the sexual abuse. The relative
	risk (with 95\% confidence interval) of decreased well-being was
	2.4 (1.1-5.2) among controls and 2.7 (1.1-6.4) among former cervical
	cancer patients. A history of both sexual abuse and cervical cancer
	gave a relative risk of 30.0 (7.0-129.0) for superficial dyspareunia.
	Sexual abuse increased the risk of sexual problems after treatment.
	The sexually abused cervical cancer patients were generally less
	willing than other patients to trade off possible maximal survival
	and forgo parts of the treatment. A history of sexual abuse and cervical
	cancer are both independent risk factors for sexual dysfunction and
	decreased well-being, and there may be a large synergy when both
	factors are combined. Diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer
	may be improved by recognition of a sexual abuse history.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: EUROCARE is the largest population-based cooperative study
	on survival of patients with cancer. The EUROCARE project aims to
	regularly monitor, analyse, and explain survival trends and between-country
	differences in survival. This report (EUROCARE-4) presents survival
	data for eight selected cancer sites and for all cancers combined,
	diagnosed in adult (aged >/=15 years) Europeans in 1995-99 and followed
	up until the end of 2003. METHODS: We analysed data from 83 cancer
	registries in 23 European countries on 2 699 086 adult cancer cases
	that were diagnosed in 1995-99 and followed up to December, 2003.
	We calculated country-specific and mean-weighted age-adjusted 5-year
	relative survival for eight major cancers. Additionally, case-mix-adjusted
	5-year survival for all cancers combined was calculated by countries
	ranked by total national expenditure on health (TNEH). Changes to
	survival were analysed relative to cases diagnosed in 1990-94. FINDINGS:
	Mean age-adjusted 5-year relative survival for colorectal (53.8\%
	[95\% CI 53.3-54.1]), lung (12.3\% [12.1-12.5]), breast (78.9\% [78.6-79.2]),
	prostate (75.7\% [75.2-76.2]), and ovarian (36.3\% [35.7-37.0]) cancer
	was highest in Nordic countries (except Denmark) and central Europe,
	intermediate in southern Europe, lower in the UK and Ireland, and
	worst in eastern Europe. Survival for melanoma (81.6\% [81.0-82.3]),
	cancer of the testis (94.2\% [93.4-95.0]), and Hodgkin's disease
	(80.0\% [79.0-81.0]) varied little with geography. All-cancer survival
	correlated with TNEH for most countries. Denmark and UK had lower
	all-cancer survival than countries with similar TNEH; Finland had
	high all-cancer survival, but moderate TNEH. Survival increased and
	intercountry survival differences narrowed between the data for 1990-94
	and 1995-99 for, notably, Hodgkin's disease (range 66.1-82.9 [IQR
	72.2-78.6] vs 74.0-83.9 [78.6-81.9]), colorectal (29.4-56.7 [45.8-54.1]
	vs 38.8-59.7 [50.7-57.5]), and breast (61.7-82.7 [72.3-78.3] vs 69.3-87.6
	[76.6-82.7]) sites. INTERPRETATION: Increases in survival and decreases
	in geographic differences over time, which are mainly due to improvements
	in health-care services in countries with poor survival, might indicate
	better cancer care. Wealthy countries with high TNEH generally had
	good cancer outcomes, but those with conspicuously worse outcomes
	than those with similar TNEH might not be allocating health resources
	efficiently.},

  abstract    = {Clinical studies often face the difficult problem of how to account
	for participants who die without experiencing the study outcome of
	interest. In a geriatric population with considerable comorbidities,
	the competing risk of death is especially high. Traditional approaches
	to describe risk of disease include Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
	and Cox proportional hazards regression, but these methods can overestimate
	risk of disease by failing to account for the competing risk of death.
	This report discusses traditional survival analysis and competing
	risk analysis as used to estimate risk of disease in geriatric studies.
	Furthermore, it illustrates a competing risk approach to estimate
	risk of second hip fracture in the Framingham Osteoporosis Study
	and compares the results with traditional survival analysis. In this
	example, survival analysis overestimated the 5-year risk of second
	hip fracture by 37\% and the 10-year risk by 75\% compared with competing
	risk estimates. In studies of older individuals in which a substantial
	number of participants die during a long follow-up, the cumulative
	incidence competing risk estimate and competing risk regression should
	be used to determine incidence and effect estimates. Use of a competing
	risk approach is critical to accurately determining disease risk
	for elderly individuals and therefore best inform clinical decision-making.},

	We fitted linear then non-linear (spline) models; investigated effect
	modification by sex, menopausal status, smoking, and age; and calculated
	population effects.5ÃÂÃÂ·24 million individuals were included; 166,955
	developed cancers of interest. BMI was associated with 17 of 22 cancers,
	but effects varied substantially by site. Each 5 kg/m(2) increase
	in BMI was roughly linearly associated with cancers of the uterus
	(hazard ratio [HR] 1ÃÂÃÂ·62, 99\% CI 1ÃÂÃÂ·56-1ÃÂÃÂ·69; p<0ÃÂÃÂ·0001), gallbladder
	(1ÃÂÃÂ·31, 1ÃÂÃÂ·12-1ÃÂÃÂ·52; p<0ÃÂÃÂ·0001), kidney (1ÃÂÃÂ·25, 1ÃÂÃÂ·17-1ÃÂÃÂ·33; p<0ÃÂÃÂ·0001),
	cervix (1ÃÂÃÂ·10, 1ÃÂÃÂ·03-1ÃÂÃÂ·17; p=0ÃÂÃÂ·00035), thyroid (1ÃÂÃÂ·09, 1ÃÂÃÂ·00-1ÃÂÃÂ·19; p=0ÃÂÃÂ·0088),
	and leukaemia (1ÃÂÃÂ·09, 1ÃÂÃÂ·05-1ÃÂÃÂ·13; p?0ÃÂÃÂ·0001). BMI was positively associated
	with liver (1ÃÂÃÂ·19, 1ÃÂÃÂ·12-1ÃÂÃÂ·27), colon (1ÃÂÃÂ·10, 1ÃÂÃÂ·07-1ÃÂÃÂ·13), ovarian (1ÃÂÃÂ·09,
	1.04-1.14), and postmenopausal breast cancers (1ÃÂÃÂ·05, 1ÃÂÃÂ·03-1ÃÂÃÂ·07) overall
	(all p<0ÃÂÃÂ·0001), but these effects varied by underlying BMI or individual-level
	characteristics. We estimated inverse associations with prostate
	and premenopausal breast cancer risk, both overall (prostate 0ÃÂÃÂ·98,
	0ÃÂÃÂ·95-1ÃÂÃÂ·00; premenopausal breast cancer 0ÃÂÃÂ·89, 0ÃÂÃÂ·86-0ÃÂÃÂ·92) and in never-smokers
	(prostate 0ÃÂÃÂ·96, 0ÃÂÃÂ·93-0ÃÂÃÂ·99; premenopausal breast cancer 0ÃÂÃÂ·89, 0ÃÂÃÂ·85-0ÃÂÃÂ·94).
	By contrast, for lung and oral cavity cancer, we observed no association
	in never smokers (lung 0ÃÂÃÂ·99, 0ÃÂÃÂ·93-1ÃÂÃÂ·05; oral cavity 1ÃÂÃÂ·07, 0ÃÂÃÂ·91-1ÃÂÃÂ·26):
	inverse associations overall were driven by current smokers and ex-smokers,
	probably because of residual confounding by smoking amount. Assuming
	causality, 41\% of uterine and 10\% or more of gallbladder, kidney,
	liver, and colon cancers could be attributable to excess weight.
	We estimated that a 1 kg/m(2) population-wide increase in BMI would
	result in 3790 additional annual UK patients developing one of the
	ten cancers positively associated with BMI.BMI is associated with

	observed and relative survival rates were calculated according to
	the Hakulinen cohort method. RESULTS: Five-year relative survival
	rate for cancer of the colon improved significantly from 39.6\% in
	1960--1964 to 57.2\% in 1995--1999 and for rectal cancer from 36.1

	rectal cancer. The largest improvement of survival were seen during
	the later part of the period observed. CONCLUSION: The survival of
	patients with colon and rectal cancer in Sweden continues to improve,
	especially in rectal cancer, which now has a 5-year observed and
	relative survival rate comparable to that for colon cancer. The survival
	improvement in rectal cancer is probably a result of the implementation

  abstract    = {Relative survival and excess mortality approaches are commonly used
	to estimate and compare net survival from cancer. These approaches
	are based on the assumption that the underlying (non-cancer) mortality
	rate of cancer patients is the same as that of the general population.
	This assumption is likely to be violated particularly in the context
	of smoking-related cancers. The magnitude of this bias has not been
	estimated. The objective of this article is to estimate the bias
	in relative survival ratios (RSRs) and excess mortality rate ratios
	(EMRRs) from using total population compared to correct subpopulation
	specific life-tables. Analyses were conducted on 1996-2001 linked
	census-cancer data (including smoking status) for people with lung
	and bladder cancer, using sex-specific (standard practice), sex-
	and ethnic-specific, sex- and smoking-specific and sex-, ethnic-
	and smoking-specific life-tables. Five-year RSRs using sex-specific
	life-tables, compared to fully stratified life-tables, were underestimated
	by 10-25\% for current smoking and Maori populations. For example,
	the current smoker male bladder cancer RSR was 0.700 for sex-specific
	life-tables, compared to 0.838 for fully stratified life-tables.
	Similarly, EMRRs comparing current to never smokers and Maori to
	non-Maori were overestimated using sex-specific life-tables only:
	modestly only for lung cancer, but markedly for bladder cancer. For
	example, the EMRR comparing current to never smokers with bladder
	cancer in a fully adjusted regression model was 1.475 when using
	sex-specific life-tables only, but reduced to 1.098 when using fully
	stratified life-tables. Substantial bias can occur when estimating
	relative cancer survival across subpopulations if non-matching life-tables
	are used.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The Cox model is widely used in the evaluation of prognostic
	factors in clinical research. However, in population-based studies,
	which assess long-term survival of unselected populations, relative-survival
	models are often considered more appropriate. In both approaches,
	the validity of proportional hazards hypothesis should be evaluated.
	METHODS: We propose a new method in which restricted cubic spline
	functions are employed to model time-by-covariate interactions in
	relative survival analyses. The method allows investigation of the
	shape of possible dependence of the covariate effect on time without
	having to specify a particular functional form. Restricted cubic
	spline functions allow graphing of such time-by-covariate interactions,
	to test formally the proportional hazards assumption, and also to
	test the linearity of the time-by-covariate interaction. RESULTS:
	Application of our new method to assess mortality in colon cancer
	provides strong evidence against the proportional hazards hypothesis,
	which is rejected for all prognostic factors. The results corroborate
	previous analyses of similar data-sets, suggesting the importance
	of both modelling of non-proportional hazards and relative survival
	approach. We also demonstrate the advantages of using restricted
	cubic spline functions for modelling non-proportional hazards in
	relative-survival analysis. The results provide new insights in the
	estimated impact of older age and of period of diagnosis. DISCUSSION:
	Using restricted cubic splines in a relative survival model allows
	the representation of both simple and complex patterns of changes
	in relative risks over time, with a single parsimonious model without
	a priori assumptions about the functional form of these changes.},

	by appropriate methods that, for one, correctly constrain inference
	to lie within the feasible range of values. In many respects, continuous

	Yet, what has long been heeded when modeling the probability of binary

	so far appears to have been overlooked with continuous bounded outcomes
	with consequences at times disastrous. Logistic quantile regression
	constitutes an effective method to fill this gap.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Long-term survival rates for many types of cancer have
	substantially improved in past decades because of advances in early
	detection and treatment. However, much of this improvement is only
	seen many years later with traditional cohort-based methods of survival
	analysis. I aimed to assess achievements in cancer patients' survival
	by an alternative method of survival analysis,known as period analysis,
	which provides more up-to-date estimates of long-term survival rates
	than do conventional methods. METHODS: The 1973-98 database of the
	Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme of the
	US National Cancer Institute was analysed by period analysis. FINDINGS:
	Estimates of 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year relative survival
	rates for all types of cancer were 63\%, 57\%, 53\%, and 51\%, respectively,
	by period analysis. These estimates were 1\%, 7\%, 11\%, and 11\%
	higher, respectively, than corresponding estimates by cohort-based
	survival analysis. By period analysis, 20-year relative survival
	rates were close to 90\% for thyroid and testis cancer, exceeded
	80\% for melanomas and prostate cancer, were about 80\% for endometrial
	cancer, and almost 70\% for bladder cancer and Hodgkin's disease.
	A 20-year relative survival rate of 65\% was estimated for breast
	cancer, of 60\% for cervical cancer, and of about 50\% for colorectal,
	ovarian, and renal cancer. INTERPRETATION: Timely detection of improvements
	in long-term survival rates might help to prevent clinicians and
	their patients from undue discouragement or depression by outdated
	and often overly pessimistic survival expectations. It also adds
	to the value of cancer surveillance as a basis for appropriate public-health
	decisions.},

	recently introduced period analysis methodology. RESULTS: Overall,
	5- and 10-year relative survival rates were approximately 99\% and
	95\%; that is, excess mortality compared with the general population
	was as low as 1\% and 5\% within 5 and 10 years following diagnosis,

	moderately differentiated localized/regional prostate cancer, and
	among these patients, 5- and 10-year relative survival rates were
	above 100\% (indicating the lack of any excess mortality) at all
	ages. CONCLUSION: While the value of PSA screening for lowering mortality
	due to prostate cancer remains to be shown by randomized clinical
	trials, the majority of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in
	the PSA screening era do not have excess mortality compared to the
	general population under current patterns of medical care. This information
	may be important for both clinical management of, and for patients'

	under-registration of deaths may lead to severe overestimation of
	long-term survival estimates, ranging from 0 to 31 percent units
	in the scenarios assessed. In general, relative survival is much
	more affected than absolute survival, and potential problems are
	much larger for relative survival estimates in older compared with
	younger patients. Potential overestimation strongly increases with
	length of follow-up, and this increase is particularly pronounced
	for under-registration of deaths because of unrecorded emigration.
	Every effort should be made in cancer registry based survival analyses

  abstract    = {Relative survival rates are among the most commonly reported outcome
	measures of cancer patients. They are calculated as ratios of observed
	survival rates and the expected survival rates in the absence of

	by dividing the standard error for absolute survival rates by the
	expected survival, without taking possible random variation of the
	latter into account. The aim of this study was to empirically assess
	the validity of these commonly reported standard errors. Using data
	from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry, the authors calculated
	5- and 10-year absolute, expected, and relative survival rates for
	patients with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989. The authors
	used bootstrap analysis to empirically assess the random error of
	absolute and relative survival rates and then compared the results
	with conventionally derived estimates of standard errors. The conventional
	and bootstrap standard errors were closely similar for all estimates
	of absolute survival. By contrast, the conventional estimates of
	standard errors of 5- and 10-year relative survival exceeded the
	bootstrap estimates by up to 17\% and 32\%, respectively. The authors

  abstract    = {PURPOSE: Breast cancer diagnosed before the age of 50 years has become
	a common disease in many developed countries. Although average remaining
	life expectancy in the affected age groups is usually several decades,
	data regarding survival perspectives beyond 10 to 20 years after
	diagnosis are sparse. The aim of this study was to assess long-term
	survival in a large population-based sample of patients diagnosed
	with breast cancer before age 50 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relative
	survival within up to 40 years after diagnosis was assessed for cohorts
	of women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years and notified
	to the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry within various time intervals
	since 1953. In addition, up-to-date estimates of 40-year relative
	survival were obtained by exclusively looking at the survival experience
	of breast cancer patients in recent years (1993 to 1999) using period
	analysis, a new method of survival analysis. RESULTS: Prognosis of
	patients diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years has considerably
	improved during the past decades. According to the latest estimates
	from period analysis, cumulative 40-year relative survival is now
	approximately 43\% for all cancers combined, 57\% for localized cancers,
	and 24\% for cancers with regional tumor spread. Nevertheless, patients
	diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 years continue to have
	increased mortality throughout at least four decades after diagnosis.
	This applies even if breast cancer is diagnosed in a localized stage
	and in the absence of a second primary breast cancer. CONCLUSION:
	Despite major improvement in prognosis over time, breast cancer occurring
	among patients who are younger than 50 years remains a chronic disease
	that affects prognosis for decades.},

	Traditional assessment of long-term survival ('cohort analysis')
	is very useful to disclose trends in long-term survival rates of
	patients diagnosed many years ago, but it does not allow the disclosure
	of recent trends in long-term survival rates. The latter can be achieved
	by an alternative method of survival analysis ('period analysis'),
	which has been proposed a few years ago. On the other hand, unlike
	cohort analysis, period analysis does not provide estimates of long-term
	survival rates for patients diagnosed in the early years after initiation
	of cancer registration. In this paper, a method of retrospective
	analysis of time trends in long-term survival rates is introduced,
	which combines the advantages of both cohort and period analysis
	('mixed analysis'). This method thereby allows for a comprehensive
	monitoring of trends in long-term survival over an extended time
	span from the earliest to the most recent years of cancer registration.
	The use of the method is illustrated for retrospective time trend
	analyses of long-term survival of cancer patients in the United States

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS)
	provides a unique database for monitoring and comparing long-term
	prognosis of children with cancer in Europe. The 'period' method
	has been shown particularly useful for that purpose. PATIENTS AND
	METHODS: The ACCIS database was used for comparative analyses of
	up-to-date long-term survival in four regions and 19 countries of
	Europe by period analysis. Overall, follow-up data on 49,503 children
	diagnosed between 1985 and the end of the 1990s were included. Period
	estimates of 10-year survival were derived for the 1995-99 period
	and compared with estimates obtained by cohort and complete analysis.
	In this article, the methodology is described and the approach is
	illustrated for all forms of childhood cancer combined. RESULTS:
	Long-term childhood cancer survival achieved in Europe by the end
	of the twentieth century is much higher than previous estimates indicated.
	The overall period estimate of 10-year survival was 71\% for all
	countries combined, but it varied between 45\% for Estonian children
	and 79\% for Swedish and Finnish children with cancer. CONCLUSION:
	Period analysis is the method of choice to monitor population-based
	survival. Despite major improvement during the past decades, tremendous
	variation in childhood cancer survival between European countries
	has persisted.},

	larger latent carcinomas increased sharply with age ans showed an
	area-to-area variation resembling that of clinical carcinoma of prostate.
	The small carcinomas were almost exclusively situated in the outer
	half of the prostate and latent carcinomas of all sizes were evenly
	distributed between the anterior and posterior halves of the prostate

	children who remained symptom-free provided a comparison group with
	respect to current respiratory symptoms, lung function, bronchial

	showed that 70 of 125 (56.0\% [95\% CI 47.3-64.5\%]) were symptom-free

	recent attacks of wheeze. When comparing the 46 children whose recurrent

	more night cough (50.0\% vs. 16.8\%; P< 0.01), were more likely to

	reactivity than their asymptomatic counterparts (1.23 mg/ml vs. 3.35

	were similar between groups. We conclude that there are a group of

	In this study, we analyzed and compared the results obtained with
	surgical and medical treatment to determine the best initial management
	for this disease.We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients
	treated for MVT in a secondary care surgical department from January
	1987 to December 1999. Before January 1995, our departmental policy
	was to perform surgery in patients with suspected MVT. Since January
	1995, we have preferred a medical approach when achievable. Each
	patient in this study was assessed for diagnosis, initial management
	(laparotomy or anticoagulation), morbidity, mortality, duration of
	hospitalization, the need for secondary operation, portal hypertension,
	and survival rates.Twenty-six patients were treated, 14 before January
	1995 (group 1) and 12 since January 1995 (group 2). Morbidity, mortality,
	secondary operation, portal hypertension, and 2-year survival rates
	were 34.6\%, 19.2\%, 15.3\%, 19.2\%, and 76.9\%, respectively. No
	statistical difference was observed between the two groups. The mean
	duration of hospitalization was 51.6 days in group 1 and 23.2 days
	in group 2 (P < .05). Among the 12 patients treated by means of laparotomy
	with bowel resection, 10 patients (83\%) had mucosal necrosis without
	transmural necrosis at pathologic study.Nonoperative management for
	acute MVT is feasible when the initial diagnosis with a computed
	tomography scan is certain and when the bowel infarction has not
	led to transmural necrosis and bowel perforation. The morbidity,
	mortality, and survival rates are similar in cases of surgical and
	nonoperative management. The length of hospital stay is shorter when
	patients are treated with a nonoperative approach. A nonoperative
	approach, when indicated, avoids the resection of macroscopically
	infarcted small bowel (without transmural necrosis) in cases that

	the Internet.In October 2002, 511 prostate cancer patients from Stockholm-Gotland
	County completed a postal questionnaire consisting of 146 questions
	regarding use of the Internet, demographic factors, level of information
	about the disease and its treatment, quality of life and trade-off
	possibilities.The response rate was 86.5\% (n=511) and the mean age
	of the respondents was 71 years. A total of 210 men (41.1\%) had
	access to the Internet. Eighty-two men (16.4\%) had looked for information
	on prostate cancer, either by themselves or with the aid of others.
	Among men aged 50-60 years, 39\% were Internet users, compared to
	8\% among men aged 75-80 years; the figures for university graduates
	versus those who had only attended elementary school were 33\% and
	3\%, respectively. Fifty of the 82 men (61\%) who searched for information
	regarded themselves as being satisfactorily informed by online information.Of
	the men in this cohort, 16\% searched the Internet for information
	regarding their prostate cancer. Young and well-educated men utilized
	the Internet more frequently than others, but they did not find information
	more often than older and less well-educated men. It is possible
	that the Internet promotes social inequality in obtaining healthcare
	in favor of well-educated, highly paid individuals.},

  abstract    = {Recently, cancer mortality has been compared to research spending
	by the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI), whose research
	budget is approximately pound sterling 250 million. The analysis
	shows a mis-match between mortality and research spending. As well
	as crude mortality rates, other measures of cancer burden should
	be considered because they contribute additional information. 'Years
	of life lost' (YLL) summed over each individual dying after a diagnosis
	of cancer represents a population-based mortality indicator of the
	impact of that disease on society. Years of life lost divided by
	the number of deaths for each cancer site produces an additional
	statistic, the average years of life lost (AYLL), which is a measure
	of the burden of cancer to the individual patient. For 17 cancer
	sites where data are available, four tumour sites have a rather large
	difference in mortality, comparing YLL to crude mortality. Years
	of life lost shows the population burden from cancers of the ovary,
	cervix, and CNS to be rather larger than suggested by crude mortality,
	despite screening programmes for cervix cancer. Using YLL, the underprovision
	of funding for lung cancer research is similar to that reported using
	percentage mortality. Breast cancer and leukaemia receive a relatively
	higher research spend than the population burden of these cancers,
	and the spending on leukaemia is quite extreme. Prostate cancer has
	a low per cent YLL but attracts a moderate amount of research spending.
	The use of AYLL as an indicator of individual cancer burden considerably
	changes the ranking of the mortality from different tumours. The
	mean AYLL is 12.5 years. Prostate cancer has the lowest AYLL, only
	6.1 years; brain tumour patients have the highest, at just over 20
	years. Comparing AYLL to research spending suggests four 'Cinderella'
	cancer sites with high individual cancer burden but low research
	spending: CNS tumours, cervix and kidney cancers, and melanoma. Breast
	cancer and leukaemia have roughly average AYLL but a considerable
	excess of research spending. YLL emphasises the discrepancy between
	research spending and mortality, and may be helpful for decisions
	concerning research support. Average years of life lost measures
	the burden to individual patients and may be helpful where individuals'
	needs are relevant, such as palliative care. As well as crude mortality,
	more subtle and comprehensive calculations of mortality statistics
	would be useful in debates on research funding and public health
	issues.},

	Such studies, that may also include relative pairs and unrelated

	determinants that modulate the subsequent progression of that disease.
	Knowledge of such determinants may pay high dividends in terms of

	may be tailored to the prognostic profile of individual patients.
	Unfortunately longitudinal family studies are difficult to analyse.
	They conflate the complex within-family correlation structure of
	a cross-sectional family study with the correlation over time that
	is intrinsic to longitudinal repeated measures. Here we describe
	an approach to analysis that is relatively straightforward to implement,
	yet is flexible in its application. It represents a natural extension
	of a Gibbs-sampling-based approach to the analysis of cross-sectional
	family studies that we have described previously. The approach can
	be applied to pedigrees of arbitrary complexity. It is applicable
	to continuous traits, repeated binary disease states, and repeated
	counts or rates with a Poisson distribution. It not only supports
	the analysis of observed determinants, including measured genotypes,
	but also allows decomposition of the correlation structure, thereby
	permitting conclusions to be drawn about the effect of unobserved
	genes and environment on key features of disease progression, and
	hence to estimate the heritability of these features. We demonstrate
	the efficacy of our methods using a range of simulated data analyses,

	data measured in families from the Framingham Heart Study.},

	actively sought information about cancer only to a limited degree,
	but the majority of patients take an interest when cancer issues
	are presented in newspapers and magazines, or on radio and television.},

	cancer between 1997-2009 to 528,658 matched prostate cancer-free
	men.During the first 6 months after diagnosis, there were 38 suicides
	among men with prostate cancer; incidence rate 0.73 per 1000 person-years
	(PY) and 30 suicides in the comparison cohort; 0.11 per 1000 PY,
	corresponding to a RR of suicide of 6.5 (95\% confidence interval

	incidence rate 1.25 per 1000 PY, RR 10 (95\% CI 5.1-21) but risk
	was also increased for men with low-risk tumours, incidence rate
	difference 0.45 per 1000 PY and RR 5.2 (95\% CI 2.3-12) and across

	increased among men with metastases, 0.57 per 1000 PY, RR 1.8 (95\%
	CI 1.1-2.9).Although the increase in absolute risk of suicide was
	modest, our findings reflect the severe psychological stress that
	prostate cancer patients may experience after diagnosis. The increased
	risk of suicide observed in men with prostate cancer, including low-risk,

	provide survival estimates for analyses of the CAPRIE trial, data
	were obtained from Saskatchewan on more than 50,000 patients like
	those in the trial: diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease (PAD),
	myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke between 1985 and 1995;
	follow-up to December 31, 2000. Mean survival was estimated by integrating
	the full survival curve derived by applying hazard functions over
	time. Cox proportional hazards analyses were carried out in each
	of four periods defined to ensure proportionality.Adjusting for mean
	age in CAPRIE, mean survival ranged from 12.1 years after index stroke
	to 13.6 years after diagnosis of PAD. Comorbidities reduced mean
	survival by 1 to 2 years. Subsequent events had a marked detrimental
	effect, decreasing life-expectancy by 50\% or more, and disease in
	multiple vascular beds led to survival of less than 5 years.These
	analyses demonstrate the analytic methods required to accurately
	estimate survival. The trial ages were much lower than in the observational
	study. Thus, the estimates are optimistic for the general population.Accurate
	valuation of interventions depends on valid survival estimates. These
	analyses confirm that survival is significantly reduced in patients
	with atherothrombotic disease, particularly with additional comorbidities.},

  abstract    = {Effects of knockdown resistance (kdr) were investigated in three pyrethroid-resistant
	(RR) strains of the Afrotropical mosquito Anopheles gambiae Giles
	(Diptera: Culicidae): Kou from Burkina Faso, Tola and Yao from Cote
	d'Ivoire; compared with a standard susceptible (SS) strain from Kisumu,
	Kenya. The kdr factor was incompletely recessive, conferring 43-fold
	resistance ratio at LD50 level and 29-fold at LD95 level, as determined
	by topical application tests with Kou strain. When adult mosquitoes
	were exposed to 0.25\% permethrin-impregnated papers, the 50\% and
	95\% knockdown times (KdT) were 23 and 42 min for SS females, compared
	with 40 and 62 min for RS (F1 Kou x Kisumu) females. On 1\% permethrin
	the KdT50 and KdT95 were 11 and 21 min for SS compared with 18 and
	33 min for RS females. Following 1 h exposure to permethrin (0.25\%
	or 1\%), no significant knockdown of Kou RR females occurred within
	24 h. Permethrin irritancy to An. gambiae was assessed by comparing
	'time to first take-off' (TO) for females. The standard TO50 and
	TO95 values for Kisumu SS on untreated paper were 58 and 1044 s,
	respectively, vs. 3.7 and 16.5 s on 1\% permethrin. For Kou RR females
	the comparable values were 27.3 s for TO50 and 294 s for TO95, with
	intermediate RS values of 10.1 s for TO50 and 71.9 s for TO95. Thus,
	TO values for RS were 2.7-4.4 times more than for SS, and those for
	RR were 7-18 times longer than for SS. Experiments with pyrethroid-impregnated
	nets were designed to induce hungry female mosquitoes to pass through
	holes cut in the netting. Laboratory 'tunnel tests' used a bait guinea-pig
	to attract mosquitoes through circular holes (5 x 1 cm) in a net
	screen. With untreated netting, 75-83\% of laboratory-reared females
	passed through the holes overnight, 63-69\% blood-fed successfully
	and 9-17\% died, with no significant differences between SS and RR
	genotypes. When the netting was treated with permethrin 250mg ai/m2
	the proportions that passed through the holes overnight were only
	10\% of SS vs. 40-46\% of RR (Tola & Kou); mortality rates were 100\%
	of SS compared with 59-82\% of RR; bloodmeals were obtained by 9\%
	of Kou RR and 17\% of Tola RR, but none of the Kisumu SS females.
	When the net was treated with deltamethrin 25 mg ai/m2 the proportions
	of An. gambiae that went through the holes and blood-fed successfully
	were 3.9\% of Kisumu SS and 3.5\% of Yaokoffikro field population
	(94\% R). Mortality rates were 97\% of Kisumu SS vs. 47\% of Yaokoffikro
	R. Evidently this deltamethrin treatment was sufficient to kill nearly
	all SS and half of the Yaokoffikro R An. gambiae population despite
	its high kdr frequency. Experimental huts at Yaokoffikro were used
	for overnight evaluation of bednets against An. gambiae females.
	The huts were sealed to prevent egress of mosquitoes released at
	20.00 hours and collected at 05.00 hours. Each net was perforated
	with 225 square holes (2 x 2 cm). A man slept under the net as bait.
	With untreated nets, only 4-6\% of mosquitoes died overnight and
	bloodmeals were taken by 17\% of SS vs. 29\% of Yaokoffikro R (P<0.05).
	Nets treated with permethrin 500 mg/m2 caused mortality rates of
	95\% Kisumu SS and 45\% Yao R (P<0.001) and blood-feeding rates were
	reduced to 1.3\% of SS vs. 8.1\% of Yao R (P<0.05). Nets treated
	with deltamethrin 25 mg/m2 caused mortality rates of 91\% Kisumu
	SS and 54\% Yao R (P<0.001) and reduced blood-feeding rates to zero
	for SS vs. 2.5\% for Yao R (P>0.05). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

	an organochlorine (DDT). With the use of World Health Organization

	was also observed when testing deltamethrin-impregnated nettings.
	With a polymerase chain reaction amplification of specific alleles
	diagnostic test, resistance was found associated with the presence
	of a kdr mutation. The strong correlation between kdr allelic frequency
	and resistance to DDT or etofenprox indicated that kdr was the main
	resistance factor for these 2 insecticides. On the contrary, a lower
	correlation was observed between kdr frequency and resistance to
	4 of the 5 pyrethroids tested, suggesting that another mechanism

	used to study the epidemiology and management of malignant large
	bowel polyps. In a 10 year period (1976-85), 146 cases were recorded
	in the area. Age standardised incidence rates were 2.7 per 100,000
	for men and 1.4 per 100,000 for women. Although incidence rates increased
	significantly during the study period, large bowel cancer diagnosed
	as a malignant polyp remained relatively rare (6.2\% of all registered
	large bowel cancers). Two malignant polyps (1.4\%) were less than
	1 cm in diameter, 34 (23.3\%) were more than 30 mm. Sixty patients
	were treated by endoscopic polypectomy, four by contact radiotherapy,
	21 by surgical local excision, 58 by colectomy (10 preceded by polypectomy),
	and three by colotomy. Operative mortality was 8.2\% after intra-abdominal
	surgery, 4.8\% after local surgical excision, and 0\% after polypectomy
	(p less than 0.05). All deaths occurred in patients over 65 years.
	The five year cumulative recurrence rates were 8.9\% after surgical
	excision and 11.3\% after endoscopic polypectomy (NS). The corresponding
	five year net survival rates were 86.1\% and 95.9\%. Endoscopic excision
	alone can be considered a sufficient treatment for adenomas with
	malignant change unless there is evidence of incomplete resection
	or a high risk of lymph node metastases.},

	method for classifying comorbid conditions which might alter the
	risk of mortality for use in longitudinal studies. A weighted index
	that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid
	disease was developed in a cohort of 559 medical patients. The 1-yr
	mortality rates for the different scores were: "0", 12\% (181); "1-2",
	26\% (225); "3-4", 52\% (71); and "greater than or equal to 5", 85\%
	(82). The index was tested for its ability to predict risk of death
	from comorbid disease in the second cohort of 685 patients during
	a 10-yr follow-up. The percent of patients who died of comorbid disease
	for the different scores were: "0", 8\% (588); "1", 25\% (54); "2",
	48\% (25); "greater than or equal to 3", 59\% (18). With each increased
	level of the comorbidity index, there were stepwise increases in
	the cumulative mortality attributable to comorbid disease (log rank
	chi 2 = 165; p less than 0.0001). In this longer follow-up, age was
	also a predictor of mortality (p less than 0.001). The new index
	performed similarly to a previous system devised by Kaplan and Feinstein.
	The method of classifying comorbidity provides a simple, readily
	applicable and valid method of estimating risk of death from comorbid
	disease for use in longitudinal studies. Further work in larger populations
	is still required to refine the approach because the number of patients
	with any given condition in this study was relatively small.},

	is unchanged.To use trends in cancer burden-incidence and mortality-to
	illustrate when changes in survival reflect true progress.Using data
	from 1975 to 2010 collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
	End Results Program (incidence, survival) and the National Center
	for Health Statistics (mortality), we analyzed US trends in five-year
	relative survival, age-adjusted incidence, and mortality for selected
	cancers to identify patterns that do and do not reflect progress.Among
	the nine common cancers examined, survival increased in seven, and
	changed little or not at all for two. In some cases, increased survival
	was accompanied by decreased burden of disease, reflecting true progress.
	For example, from 1975 to 2010, five-year survival for colon cancer
	patients improved (from 48\% to 68\%) while cancer burden fell: Fewer
	cases (incidence decreased from 60 to 41 per 100000) and fewer deaths

	survival did not reflect true progress. In melanoma, kidney, and
	thyroid cancer, five-year survival increased but incidence increased
	with no change in mortality. This pattern suggests overdiagnosis
	from increased early detection, an increase in cancer burden.Changes
	in survival must be interpreted in the context of incidence and mortality.
	Increased survival only represents progress when accompanied by a

  abstract    = {OBJECTIVES: There exists a lack of extrapolation methods for long-term
	survival analysis when censored rates are high (25-50\%). This study
	aimed at estimating life expectancy (LE) after the diagnosis of cancer
	and the expected years of life lost (EYLL) using a newly developed
	semiparametric method. METHODS: Patients (n = 425,294) diagnosed
	with 17 different types of major cancer were enrolled. All of the
	patients were registered with the Taiwan Cancer Registry between
	1990 and 2001; their survivals were followed through the end of 2004.
	The survival function for an age- and sex-matched reference population
	was generated using the Monte Carlo method from the life table of
	the general population. Lifetime survival of the cancer patients
	(up to 50 years) were obtained using linear extrapolation of a logit-transformed
	curve of the survival ratio between the cancer and reference populations.
	The estimates were compared with the results from the extrapolation
	of fitted Weibull models. RESULTS: The 15-year survival, LE, and
	EYLL for 17 different types of cancer were determined, of which the
	LE of breast, cervical, ovarian, and skin cancers exceeded 15 years;
	nasopharyneal, leukemia, bladder, kidney, and colorectal cancers
	exceeded 10 years. Validity tests indicated that the relative biases
	of the extrapolated estimates were usually <5\% under high censoring
	rates. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed method is feasible and relatively
	accurate to project LE and EYLL, which could also be merged with
	data pertaining to quality of life, for a more detailed outcome assessment
	in the future.},

	and age-period-cohort models are available using one-dimensional
	smoothing splines. We also propose using two-dimensional smoothing

	and measures of predictive performance for recent predictions. The
	models were applied to data from the World Health Organization Mortality
	Database for females in five countries. Model choice between the
	age-period-cohort models and the two-dimensional models was equivocal
	with respect to cross-validation, while the two-dimensional GAMs
	had very good predictive performance. The Bayesian model performed
	poorly due to imprecise predictions and the assumption of linearity
	outside of observed data. In summary, the two-dimensional GAM performed

	of health-care systems. Persistent regional and international differences
	in survival represent many avoidable deaths. Differences in survival
	have prompted or guided cancer control strategies. This is the first
	study in a programme to investigate international survival disparities,
	with the aim of informing health policy to raise standards and reduce
	inequalities in survival. METHODS: Data from population-based cancer
	registries in 12 jurisdictions in six countries were provided for
	XX million adults diagnosed with primary colorectal, lung, breast
	(women), or ovarian cancer during 1995-2007, with follow-up to Dec
	31, 2007. Data quality control and analyses were done centrally with
	a common protocol, overseen by external experts. We estimated 1-year
	and 5-year relative survival, constructing 252 complete life tables
	to control for background mortality by age, sex, and calendar year.
	We report age-specific and age-standardised relative survival at
	1 and 5 years, and 5-year survival conditional on survival to the
	first anniversary of diagnosis. We also examined incidence and mortality
	trends during 1985-2005. FINDINGS: Relative survival improved during
	1995-2007 for all four cancers in all jurisdictions. Survival was
	persistently higher in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, intermediate
	in Norway, and lower in Denmark, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales,
	particularly in the first year after diagnosis and for patients aged
	65 years and older. International differences narrowed at all ages
	for breast cancer, from about 9\% to 5\% at 1 year and from about
	14\% to 8\% at 5 years, but less or not at all for the other cancers.
	For colorectal cancer, the international range narrowed only for
	patients aged 65 years and older, by 2-6\% at 1 year and by 2-3\%
	at 5 years. INTERPRETATION: Up-to-date survival trends show increases
	but persistent differences between countries. Trends in cancer incidence
	and mortality are broadly consistent with these trends in survival.
	Data quality and changes in classification are not likely explanations.
	The patterns are consistent with later diagnosis or differences in
	treatment, particularly in Denmark and the UK, and in patients aged
	65 years and older. FUNDING: Department of Health, England; and Cancer

	cancer, and the survival that would have been expected had they been
	subject only to the background mortality rates. 2800 life tables
	were constructed. Survival estimates were also adjusted for differences
	in the age structure of populations of patients with cancer. FINDINGS:
	Global variation in cancer survival was very wide. 5-year relative
	survival for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer was generally
	higher in North America, Australia, Japan, and northern, western,
	and southern Europe, and lower in Algeria, Brazil, and eastern Europe.
	CONCORD has provided the first opportunity to estimate cancer survival
	in 11 states in USA covered by the National Program of Cancer Registries
	(NPCR), and the study covers 42\% of the US population, four-fold
	more than previously available. Cancer survival in black men and
	women was systematically and substantially lower than in white men
	and women in all 16 states and six metropolitan areas included. Relative
	survival for all ethnicities combined was 2-4\% lower in states covered
	by NPCR than in areas covered by the Surveillance Epidemiology and
	End Results (SEER) Program. Age-standardised relative survival by
	use of the appropriate race-specific and state-specific life tables
	was up to 2\% lower for breast cancer and up to 5\% lower for prostate
	cancer than with the census-derived national life tables used by
	the SEER Program. These differences in population coverage and analytical
	method have both contributed to the survival deficit noted between
	Europe and the USA, from which only SEER data have been available
	until now. INTERPRETATION: Until now, direct comparisons of cancer
	survival between high-income and low-income countries have not generally
	been available. The information provided here might therefore be
	a useful stimulus for change. The findings should eventually facilitate
	joint assessment of international trends in incidence, survival,
	and mortality as indicators of cancer control.},

	Patients were assigned to one of five deprivation categories (from

	We estimated trends in survival and in the difference in survival
	between deprivation categories ('deprivation gap') over the periods

	to implement case-cohort analysis methods using SPSS, a popular statistical

	and implement published methods based on other software platforms.
	We also illustrate case-control analysis using Epicure, which provides

	and/or mitral annuloplasty. Postoperative anticoagulation (heparin)
	was prescribed for ten days, followed by antiplatelet therapy. No
	long-term oral anticoagulants were prescribed, except in some patients
	with atrial fibrillation. The follow up included routine clinical
	and blood work-up, and echocardiography at six months and one year
	after surgery.There were seven early (0-30 days) and five late deaths
	(>30 days). One death was caused by a hemorrhagic stroke at three
	months in a patient without anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.
	No thromboembolic complications or structural valve deterioration
	were observed during follow up. At two years, freedom from endocarditis
	and reoperation was each 99.6\%. NYHA class was excellent, with 98\%
	of patients in class I or II at one year. Patient survival was 92\%
	at two years. Hemodynamically, the valve was performing well, with
	mean systolic gradients of 13.6, 13.2, 12.6 and 9.6 mmHg for the
	21, 23, 25 and 27 mm valves, respectively. There was no evidence
	of structural valve deterioration.Long-term evaluations are mandatory
	to confirm the durability of any new bioprosthetic valve. Satisfactory
	early clinical and hemodynamic results with the new Mosaic bioprosthesis
	warrant its continued implantation in the aortic position for patients
	over the age of 70 years.},

	is to assume an additive form between the expected population hazard
	and the excess hazard due to the presence of an additional cause
	of mortality. Within this context, the existing approaches in the
	parametric, semiparametric and non-parametric setting are compared
	and discussed. We study the additive excess hazards models, where
	the excess hazard is on additive form. This makes it possible to
	assess the importance of time-varying effects for regression models
	in the relative survival framework. We show how recent developments
	can be used to make inferential statements about the non-parametric
	version of the model. This makes it possible to test the key hypothesis
	that an excess risk effect is time varying in contrast to being constant
	over time. In case some covariate effects are constant, we show how
	the semiparametric additive risk model can be considered in the excess
	risk setting, providing a better and more useful summary of the data.
	Estimators have explicit form and inference based on a resampling
	scheme is presented for both the non-parametric and semiparametric
	models. We also describe a new suggestion for goodness of fit of
	relative survival models, which consists on statistical and graphical
	tests based on cumulative martingale residuals. This is illustrated
	on the semiparametric model with proportional excess hazards. We
	analyze data from the TRACE study using different approaches and
	show the need for more flexible models in relative survival.},

  abstract    = {In a recent tutorial my colleagues and I advocated the generalized
	gamma (GG) distribution as a platform for parametric survival analysis.
	The GG family includes all four of the common types of hazard functions,
	making it particularly useful for estimating individual hazard functions
	as well as both relative hazards and relative times. In addition,
	the GG includes most of the commonly used parametric survival distributions.
	Survival analysis based on the GG distribution is practical since
	regression models are available in commonly used statistical packages.
	It is well known that the GG is contained in an even larger family,
	the generalized F (GF) distribution, which also includes the log
	logistic. The GF thus provides additional flexibility for parametric
	modeling. In this paper we discuss the GF family from this perspective.
	We provide a characterization of the hazard functions of the GF,
	showing that, except for the GG, the available hazard functions are
	limited to decreasing and arc-shaped hazards and, in particular,
	that the hazard function can be decreasing but not monotone. We also
	discuss fitting the GF with an alternative parameterization using
	standard statistical software and refine a description of the hazard
	functions for death after a diagnosis of clinical AIDS in four different

  abstract    = {A common population-based cancer progress measure for net survival
	(survival in the absence of other causes) of cancer patients is relative
	survival. Relative survival is defined as the ratio of a population
	of observed survivors in a cohort of cancer patients to the proportion
	of expected survivors in a comparable set of cancer-free individuals
	in the general public, thus giving a measure of excess mortality
	due to cancer. Relative survival was originally designed to address
	the question of whether or not there is evidence that patients have
	been cured. It has proven to be a useful survival measure in several
	areas, including the evaluation of cancer control efforts and the
	application of cure models. However, it is not representative of
	the actual survival patterns observed in a cohort of cancer patients.
	This paper suggests a measure for cumulative crude (in the presence
	of other causes) cause-specific probability of death for a population
	diagnosed with cancer. The measure does not use cause of death information
	which can be unreliable for population cancer registries. Point estimates
	and variances are derived for crude cause-specific probability of
	death using relative survival instead of cause of death information.
	Examples are given for men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer
	over the age of 70 and women diagnosed with regional breast cancer
	using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program data.
	The examples emphasize the differences in crude and net mortality
	measures and suggest areas where a crude measure is more informative.
	Estimates of this type are especially important for older patients
	as new screening modalities detect cancers earlier and choice of
	treatment or even 'watchful waiting' become viable options. Published

	We describe a flexible parametric approach for the survival submodel
	that models the log baseline cumulative hazard using restricted cubic
	splines. This approach overcomes limitations of standard parametric
	choices for the survival submodel, which can lack the flexibility
	to effectively capture the shape of the underlying hazard function.
	Numerical integration techniques, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature,
	are usually required to evaluate both the cumulative hazard and the
	overall joint likelihood; however, by using a flexible parametric
	model, the cumulative hazard has an analytically tractable form,
	providing considerable computational benefits. We conduct an extensive
	simulation study to assess the proposed model, comparing it with
	a B-spline formulation, illustrating insensitivity of parameter estimates
	to the baseline cumulative hazard function specification. Furthermore,
	we compare non-adaptive and fully adaptive quadrature, showing the
	superiority of adaptive quadrature in evaluating the joint likelihood.
	We also describe a useful technique to simulate survival times from
	complex baseline hazard functions and illustrate the methods using
	an example data set investigating the association between longitudinal

	clinical trials, and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses,
	to investigate heterogeneity in baseline risk and covariate effects.
	In this paper, we extend parametric frailty models including the
	exponential, Weibull and Gompertz proportional hazards (PH) models
	and the log logistic, log normal, and generalized gamma accelerated
	failure time models to allow any number of normally distributed random
	effects. Furthermore, we extend the flexible parametric survival
	model of Royston and Parmar, modeled on the log-cumulative hazard
	scale using restricted cubic splines, to include random effects while
	also allowing for non-PH (time-dependent effects). Maximum likelihood
	is used to estimate the models utilizing adaptive or nonadaptive
	Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The methods are evaluated through simulation
	studies representing clinically plausible scenarios of a multicenter
	trial and IPD meta-analysis, showing good performance of the estimation
	method. The flexible parametric mixed effects model is illustrated
	using a dataset of patients with kidney disease and repeated times
	to infection and an IPD meta-analysis of prognostic factor studies
	in patients with breast cancer. User-friendly Stata software is provided
	to implement the methods.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of invasive lobular carcinoma has been increasing
	among postmenopausal women in some parts of the United States. Part
	of this may be due to changes in classification over time. However,
	the use of combined (estrogen and progestin) hormone replacement
	therapy (CHRT) also has increased during the last decade and may
	account in part for the increase in invasive lobular breast carcinoma.
	METHODS: A large, multicenter case-control study of Caucasian and
	African-American women who were diagnosed at age < 65 years with
	their first invasive breast tumor from July 1, 1994 through April
	30, 1998 was conducted. In-person interviews were conducted with
	1749 postmenopausal patients, and their responses were compared with
	the responses of 1953 postmenopausal control women identified through
	random-digit dialing who met the study criteria of being postmenopausal
	at the time of diagnosis. Polytomous logistic regression was used
	to calculate the odds ratio (OR) as an estimate of the relative risk
	and to compute the 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI) associated with
	the use of various regimens of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
	among women diagnosed with ductal breast carcinoma, lobular (or mixed
	lobular and ductal) breast carcinoma, and a grouping of other histologic
	types of breast carcinoma. RESULTS: Ever use of unopposed estrogen
	therapy (ERT) was not associated with an increase in the risk of
	any histologic type of breast carcinoma. The risk of invasive lobular
	breast carcinoma and the risk of breast carcinoma of the grouping
	of other histologies increased among women currently using CHRT (OR,
	2.2; 95\%CI, 1.4-3.3; and OR, 1.9; 95\%CI, 1.0-3.4, respectively).
	The risk increase was greater for the mixed lobular-ductal type than
	for the pure lobular type of breast carcinoma, although the difference
	was not statistically significant. There was some indication that
	>or= 5 years of continuous CHRT (>or= 25 days per month of progestin)
	was associated with a higher risk of lobular breast carcinoma (OR,
	2.5; 95\%CI, 1.4-4.3) compared with sequential CHRT (< 25 days per
	month of progestin; OR, 1.5; 95\%CI, 0.8-2.6). Current use of continuous
	CHRT was only moderately associated with risk of ductal breast carcinoma.
	CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women who take CHRT appear to be at an
	increased risk of lobular breast carcinoma. Data from this study
	suggest that neither ERT use nor CHRT substantially increase the
	risk of ductal breast carcinoma among women age < 65 years.},

  abstract    = {Net survival, the one that would be observed if cancer were the only
	cause of death, is the most appropriate indicator to compare cancer
	mortality between areas or countries. Several parametric and non-parametric
	methods have been developed to estimate net survival, particularly
	when the cause of death is unknown. These methods are based either
	on the relative survival ratio or on the additive excess hazard model,
	the latter using the general population mortality hazard to estimate
	the excess mortality hazard (the hazard related to net survival).
	The present work used simulations to compare estimator abilities
	to estimate net survival in different settings such as the presence/absence
	of an age effect on the excess mortality hazard or on the potential
	time of follow-up, knowing that this covariate has an effect on the
	general population mortality hazard too. It showed that when age
	affected the excess mortality hazard, most estimators, including
	specific survival, were biased. Only two estimators were appropriate
	to estimate net survival. The first is based on a multivariable excess
	hazard model that includes age as covariate. The second is non-parametric
	and is based on the inverse probability weighting. These estimators
	take differently into account the informative censoring induced by
	the expected mortality process. The former offers great flexibility
	whereas the latter requires neither the assumption of a specific
	distribution nor a model-building strategy. Because of its simplicity
	and availability in commonly used software, the nonparametric estimator
	should be considered by cancer registries for population-based studies.},

	myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from

	for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark; the

	Individual patient information was obtained from hospital records.
	For each woman, the mean radiation doses to the whole heart and to
	the left anterior descending coronary artery were estimated from
	her radiotherapy chart.The overall average of the mean doses to the
	whole heart was 4.9 Gy (range, 0.03 to 27.72). Rates of major coronary

	The mean ipsilateral (ie, on the same side as the breast cancer)

	from cancer of the right or the left lung decades later. This study
	aimed to assess the hazards in the general US population from routine
	cancer-registry and death-certificate data.We analysed data for 308
	861 US women with early breast cancer of known laterality (left-sided
	or right-sided) who were registered in the US Surveillance Epidemiology
	and End Results (SEER) cancer registries during 1973-2001 and followed

	165 (37\%) received radiotherapy. Among those who did not, tumour
	laterality was of little relevance to subsequent mortality. For women

	(left versus right tumour laterality) was 1.20 (95\% CI 1.04-1.38)
	less than 10 years afterwards, 1.42 (1.11-1.82) 10-14 years afterwards,

	ratio was 1.04 (0.91-1.18) less than 10 years afterwards and 1.27
	(0.99-1.63) 10 or more years afterwards. For women diagnosed during
	1993-2001 and irradiated the cardiac mortality ratio was 0.96 (0.82-1.12),
	with none yet followed for 10 years. Among women irradiated for breast
	cancer who subsequently developed an ipsilateral or contralateral
	lung cancer, the lung cancer mortality ratio (ipsilateral versus
	contralateral) for women diagnosed during 1973-82 and irradiated
	was 1.17 (0.62-2.19), 2.00 (1.00-4.00), and 2.71 (1.65-4.48), respectively,

	(trend: 2p=0.04). For women irradiated after 1982 there is, as yet,
	little information on lung cancer risks more than 10 years afterwards.US
	breast cancer radiotherapy regimens of the 1970s and early 1980s
	appreciably increased mortality from heart disease and lung cancer
	10-20 years afterwards with, as yet, little direct evidence on the

  abstract    = {Cancer survival is a key measure of the effectiveness of health-care
	systems. EUROCARE-the largest cooperative study of population-based
	cancer survival in Europe-has shown persistent differences between
	countries for cancer survival, although in general, cancer survival
	is improving. Major changes in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation
	occurred in the early 2000s. EUROCARE-5 assesses their effect on
	cancer survival in 29 European countries.In this retrospective observational
	study, we analysed data from 107 cancer registries for more than
	10 million patients with cancer diagnosed up to 2007 and followed
	up to 2008. Uniform quality control procedures were applied to all
	datasets. For patients diagnosed 2000-07, we calculated 5-year relative
	survival for 46 cancers weighted by age and country. We also calculated
	country-specific and age-specific survival for ten common cancers,
	together with survival differences between time periods (for 1999-2001,
	2002-04, and 2005-07).5-year relative survival generally increased
	steadily over time for all European regions. The largest increases
	from 1999-2001 to 2005-07 were for prostate cancer (73.4\% [95\%
	CI 72.9-73.9] vs 81.7\% [81.3-82.1]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (53.8\%
	[53.3-54.4] vs 60.4\% [60.0-60.9]), and rectal cancer (52.1\% [51.6-52.6]
	vs 57.6\% [57.1-58.1]). Survival in eastern Europe was generally
	low and below the European mean, particularly for cancers with good
	or intermediate prognosis. Survival was highest for northern, central,
	and southern Europe. Survival in the UK and Ireland was intermediate
	for rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma,
	and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but low for kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon,
	and lung cancers. Survival for lung cancer in the UK and Ireland
	was much lower than for other regions for all periods, although results
	for lung cancer in some regions (central and eastern Europe) might
	be affected by overestimation. Survival usually decreased with age,
	although to different degrees depending on region and cancer type.The
	major advances in cancer management that occurred up to 2007 seem
	to have resulted in improved survival in Europe. Likely explanations
	of differences in survival between countries include: differences
	in stage at diagnosis and accessibility to good care, different diagnostic
	intensity and screening approaches, and differences in cancer biology.
	Variations in socioeconomic, lifestyle, and general health between
	populations might also have a role. Further studies are needed to
	fully interpret these findings and how to remedy disparities.Italian

  abstract    = {In traditional Kaplan-Meier or Cox regression analysis, usually a
	risk factor measured at baseline is related to mortality thereafter.
	During follow-up, however, things may change: either the effect of
	a fixed baseline risk factor may vary over time, resulting in a weakening
	or strengthening of associations over time, or the risk factor itself
	may vary over time. In this paper, short-term versus long-term effects
	(so-called time-dependent effects) of a fixed baseline risk factor
	are addressed. An example is presented showing that underweight is
	a strong risk factor for mortality in dialysis patients, especially
	in the short run. In contrast, overweight is a risk factor for mortality,
	which is stronger in the long run than in the short run. In addition,
	the analysis of how time-varying risk factors (so-called time-dependent
	risk factors) are related to mortality is demonstrated by paying
	attention to the pitfall of adjusting for sequelae. The proper analysis
	of effects over time should be driven by a clear research question.
	Both kinds of research questions, that is those of time-dependent
	effects as well those of time-dependent risk factors, can be analyzed
	with time-dependent Cox regression analysis. It will be shown that
	using time-dependent risk factors usually implies focusing on short-term
	effects only.},

	80+ years. The 5-year relative survival ratios in the last calendar

  abstract    = {PURPOSE: Androgen deprivation therapy increases the risk of osteoporosis
	related fractures. This issue is of increasing importance in men
	with prostate cancer as increasingly more undergo androgen deprivation
	therapy and therapy is administered sooner following diagnosis. Data
	directly addressing the long-term fracture risk in men diagnosed
	with prostate cancer are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using population
	based registries in Sweden we studied the incidence of hip fractures
	in 17,731 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1964 to 1996 who
	were treated with bilateral orchiectomy within 6 months of diagnosis.
	The fracture incidence was compared to the incidence in 43,230 men
	diagnosed with prostate cancer but not treated with orchiectomy and
	in 362,354 of similar age who were randomly selected from the general
	population. RESULTS: Men treated with orchiectomy were at increased
	risk for hip fracture. The estimated relative risk comparing men
	who underwent orchiectomy to population controls was 2.11 (95\% CI
	1.94 to 2.29) for femoral neck fractures and 2.16 (95\% CI 1.97 to
	2.36) for intertrochanter fractures. An increased risk of hip fracture
	was observed as early as 6 months after orchiectomy and the relative
	risk remained fairly constant up to 15 years following orchiectomy.
	CONCLUSIONS: Hip fracture risk increases almost immediately following
	orchiectomy and the excess risk persists for at least 15 years. This
	side effect should be considered when assessing the merits of androgen
	deprivation therapy, particularly in symptom-free men diagnosed with
	localized prostate cancer. Measures to prevent osteoporosis should
	be considered in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.},

  abstract    = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Estimation of cancer patient survival by social
	class has been performed using observed, corrected (cause specific),
	and relative (with expected survival based on the national population)
	survival rates. Each of these measures are potentially biased and
	the optimal method is to calculate relative survival rates using
	social class specific death rates to estimate expected survival.
	This study determined the degree to which the choice of survival
	measure affects the estimation of social class differences in cancer
	patient survival. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All Finnish residents
	diagnosed with at least one of 10 common malignant neoplasms during
	the period 1977-1985 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry
	and followed up for deaths to the end of 1992. DESIGN: Survival rates
	were calculated by site, sex, and age at 5, 10, and 15 years subsequent
	to diagnosis for each of three measures of survival; relative survival,
	corrected (cause specific) survival, and relative survival adjusted
	for social class differences in general mortality. Regression models
	were fitted to each set of rates for the first five years of follow
	up. MAIN RESULTS: The degree of variation in relative survival resulting
	from social class decreased, although did not disappear, after controlling
	for social class differences in general mortality. The results obtained
	using corrected survival were close to those obtained using relative
	survival with a social class correction. The differences between
	the three measures were largest when the proportion of deaths from
	other causes was large, for example, in cancers with high survival,
	among older patients, and for longer follow up times. CONCLUSIONS:
	Although each of the three measures gave comparable results, it is
	recommended that relative survival rates are used with expected survival
	adjusted for social class when studying social class variation in
	cancer patient survival. If this is not an available option, it is
	recommended that corrected survival rates are used. Relative survival
	rates without the social class correction overestimate social class
	differences and should be used with caution.},

	those cancer sites which exhibit high levels of systematic regional

	the reduction in cancer deaths which could be achieved by eliminating
	this variation so that everyone receives effective care will provide
	a readily interpretable measure of the amount of systematic regional
	variation. A comprehensive analysis of regional variation in survival
	has not previously been conducted so appropriate statistical methodology
	must be developed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All those aged 0-90
	years who had been diagnosed with at least one of 12 common malignant
	neoplasms between 1977 and 1992 in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and
	Sweden. DESIGN: A separate analysis was conducted for each country.
	Regression models for the relative survival ratio were used to estimate
	the relative risk of excess mortality attributable to cancer in each
	region after correcting for age and sex. An estimate of the amount
	of systematic regional variation in survival was obtained by subtracting
	the estimated expected random variation from the observed regional
	variation. An estimate was then made of the potential reduction in
	the number of cancer deaths for 2008-12 if regional variation in
	survival were eliminated so that everyone received the same level
	of effective care. MAIN RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, an estimated
	2.5\% of deaths from cancers in the 12 sites studied could be prevented
	by eliminating regional variation in survival. The percentage of
	potentially avoidable deaths did not depend on country or sex but
	it did depend on cancer site. There was no relationship between the
	level of regional variation in a given country and the level of survival.
	The cancer sites for which the greatest percentage savings could
	be achieved were melanoma (11\%) and cervix uteri (6\%). The sites
	for which the highest number of deaths could be prevented were prostate,
	colon, melanoma, and breast. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology showed
	a small amount of systematic regional variation in cancer survival

  abstract    = {INTRODUCTION: The study of survival of cancer patients is essential
	for monitoring the effectiveness of cancer control. The previous
	monograph describing cancer patient survival in Finland was published
	by the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1981 and covered patients diagnosed
	in 1953-1974. This new supplement assesses cancer patient survival
	up to the year 1995. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study includes over
	560000 tumours registered at the Finnish Cancer Registry with a date
	of diagnosis between 1955 and 1994. Patients were followed up to
	the end of 1995. Trends in relative survival rates are studied over
	four 10-year diagnostic periods from 1955 to 1994. In addition, detailed
	results are presented for patients diagnosed during 1985-1994, including
	relative survival rates tabulated by stage, sex, and age. Additional
	sections describe differences in cancer patient survival according
	to social class and region of residence and a comparison of cancer
	patient survival in Finland to other European countries. RESULTS:
	Patient survival improved over time for almost all anatomical sites.
	The main exception is in cancer of the cervix uteri, where patient
	survival has decreased slightly from 1965-1974 to 1985-1994 due to
	the selective prevention of less aggressive tumours through cytologic
	screening. Very few differences in patient survival are observed
	between males and females. A substantial improvement in survival
	can be seen for childhood cancers. CONCLUSION: The increasing survival
	rates reflect improvements that have taken place in various areas
	of cancer control, from health education and early diagnosis to treatment
	and aftercare. This study provides valuable reference information
	for both clinicians and health administrators, as well as a baseline
	for more detailed studies of patient survival for individual anatomical
	sites.},

	cancer risk appears minimal. The annual number of thyroid examinations
	using radioiodine is currently 5 per 1,000 individuals worldwide,
	so this issue is of public health importance. Our objective was to
	evaluate the excess risk of thyroid cancer following a range of known
	doses of (131)I administered for diagnostic purposes. We conducted
	a nationwide, population-based cohort study in {S}weden including
	all 36,792 individuals who received (131)I for diagnostic purposes
	during 1952-1969 and were alive and free of thyroid cancer 2 years
	after exposure. Accrual of person-time at risk commenced 2 years
	after the first (131)I administration. Follow-up for cancer was to
	the end of 1998. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated
	as the ratio between the observed and expected numbers of thyroid
	cancers. Estimates were stratified by previous exposure to external
	radiation therapy to the neck, reason for thyroid examination, (131)I
	dose, sex, age at exposure and time since exposure. Thyroid cancers
	(n = 129) were diagnosed during 886,618 person-years at risk. Excess
	thyroid cancers were observed only among the 1,767 patients who reported
	previous external radiation therapy to the neck [SIR = 9.8, 95\%
	confidence interval (CI) 6.3-14.6] and among those originally referred
	due to suspicion of a thyroid tumor (SIR = 3.5, 95\% CI 2.7-4.4 for
	11,015 patients without previous external radiation therapy). The
	24,010 patients without previous exposure to external radiation therapy
	to the neck who were referred for a reason other than suspicion of
	a thyroid tumor received an estimated dose to the thyroid of 0.94
	Gy. Among these patients, 36 thyroid cancers were observed compared
	to 39.5 expected (SIR = 0.91, 95\% CI 0.64-1.26). We found no evidence
	that administration of (131)I for diagnostic purposes increases risk
	of thyroid cancer. However, our study included few patients under
	age 20, so the results apply primarily to exposure among adults.
	Our data suggest that protraction of dose may result in a lower risk
	than brief X-ray exposure of the same total dose.},

	using the method of maximum likelihood are described and compared.
	The underlying model is an additive hazards model where the total
	hazard is written as the sum of the known baseline hazard and the
	excess hazard associated with a diagnosis of cancer. The excess hazards
	are assumed to be constant within pre-specified bands of follow-up.
	The likelihood can be maximized directly or in the framework of generalized
	linear models. Minor differences exist due to, for example, the way
	the data are presented (individual, aggregated or grouped), and in
	some assumptions (e.g. distributional assumptions). The four approaches
	are applied to two real data sets and produce very similar estimates
	even when the assumption of proportional excess hazards is violated.
	The choice of approach to use in practice can, therefore, be guided
	by ease of use and availability of software. We recommend using a
	generalized linear model with a Poisson error structure based on
	collapsed data using exact survival times. The model can be estimated
	in any software package that estimates GLMs with user-defined link
	functions (including SAS, Stata, S-plus, and R) and utilizes the

  abstract    = {The taxanes and Herceptin have been shown to possess significant clinical
	activity in metastatic breast cancer. Preclinical testing of taxane/Herceptin
	combinations demonstrated additive and synergistic interactions with
	paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. In a pivotal clinical trial,
	combination of paclitaxel (3-weekly) and Herceptin was associated
	with an increased response rate compared with paclitaxel monotherapy
	(41\% vs. 17\%; p = 0.001). The combination therapy also significantly
	improved time to disease progression (6.9 vs. 2.7 months; p < 0.05).
	In a phase II study of weekly paclitaxel plus Herceptin in patients
	with normal or increased tumor HER2 levels, a response was observed
	in 60\% of patients and the regimen was well tolerated. Responses
	were more frequent in patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors (83\%
	vs. 45\%). Preliminary results from a phase II study of Herceptin
	plus docetaxel in patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors indicate
	significant activity, with a response observed in 7 (44\%) of 16
	evaluable patients. The preliminary results of a trial of weekly
	docetaxel and Herceptin demonstrate a response rate of 54\% in 13
	evaluable patients. Additional European trials of Hercep- tin/taxane
	combinations as first- and second-line and adjuvant therapy are ongoing.
	The results of the studies to date indicate that regimens combining
	Herceptin with 3-weekly and weekly taxane are effective and well
	tolerated.},

	For example, individuals undergoing treatment for surgically resectable

	death resulting from noncancer causes before any of these events.
	Two quantities, the cause-specific hazard function and the cumulative

	type. Tests for event-specific differences between treatment groups
	may thus be based on comparison of (a) cause-specific hazards via
	a log-rank or related test, or (b) the cumulative incidence functions
	via one of several available tests. Inferential results for tests
	based on these different metrics can differ considerably for the
	same cause-specific end point. Depending on the questions of principal
	interest, one or both metrics may be appropriate to consider. We
	present simulation study results and discuss examples from cancer
	clinical trials to illustrate these points and provide guidance for

	the production of inflammatory cytokines by human bronchial epithelium
	(HBE) cells in vitro. The present study investigates the effects
	of DEPs on the interaction of l-HBE cells (16HBE14o-) with the cell
	and matrix microenvironment based on evaluation of integrin-type
	cell/matrix ligand expression, cytoskeleton (CSK) stiffness, and
	matrix remodeling via matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, and
	MMP-9 expression. The results showed that DEP exposure induced: 1)
	a net dose-dependent decrease in CSK stiffness through actin fibers,
	2) a concomitant specific reduction of both alpha(3)- and beta(1)-integrin
	subunits extensively expressed on the HBE cell surface, 3) a decrease
	in the level of CD44, which is a major HBE cell-cell and HBE cell-matrix
	adhesion molecule; and 4) an isolated decrease in MMP-1 expression
	without any change in tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase
	(TIMP)-1 or TIMP-2 tissue inhibitors. Restrictive modulation of cell-matrix
	interaction, cell-cell connection, CSK stiffness, and fibrillary
	collagen remodeling results in a decreased wound closure capacity
	and an increased deadhesion capacity. In conclusion, on the basis
	of these results, we can propose that, in addition to their ability
	to increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, DEPs could
	also alter the links between actin CSK and the extracellular matrix,
	suggesting that they might facilitate HBE cell detachment in vivo.},

	parenteral nutrition (TPN) via plastic bags changed once daily, compared
	to glass bottles changed thrice daily, could be offset by savings
	from a reduction in nosocomial infections.The costs and potential
	benefits of commercially available TPN bags and TPN in glass containers
	were compared. Costs were computed from the viewpoint of the hospital,
	first in a general model and then for two specific examples, Crohn's
	disease and intensive-care unit (ICU) patients. The extra cost of
	using bags was $20 per day. The total cost of nosocomial bacteremia
	was estimated at $6,000. The monetary benefits of using TPN bags
	were $6,000XT, where XT was the percentage of nosocomial infections
	averted. We also considered that reduction in intravenous (IV)-line
	manipulation could reduce bacteremia-related mortality and computed
	a cost-per-life-saved ratio.Modeling showed that TPN in bags could
	yield a net benefit when the absolute reduction in the daily risk
	of nosocomial bacteremia reached the threshold value of 0.3\%. Such
	a reduction could not be attained in patients with Crohn's disease,
	and corresponded to a 50\% to 60\% reduction of infection rates in
	ICU patients. Varying the risk of mortality attributable to IV-line-related
	infection from 1\% to 13\% resulted in a cost effectiveness of using
	TPN bags ranging from $90,000 to $7,000 per life saved in ICU, assuming
	a two-thirds reduction in IV-line infections, and from $180,000 to
	$14,000 if the infection rate was reduced by one third.The baseline
	cost-minimization analysis concluded that the extra cost of TPN bags
	was not justified by the extra savings. The cost-effectiveness analysis,
	however, found that the cost per life saved fell within the accepted

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Several reports have shown that less aggressive patterns
	of diagnostic activity and care are provided to elderly breast carcinoma
	patients. We sought to investigate whether differences in the management
	of older women with breast cancer are associated with survival. METHODS
	AND FINDINGS: In an observational study using a population-based
	clinical breast cancer register of one health-care region in {S}weden,
	we identified 9,059 women aged 50-84 y diagnosed with primary breast
	cancer between 1992 and 2002. The 5-y relative survival ratio was
	estimated for patients classified by age group, diagnostic activity,
	tumor characteristics, and treatment. The 5-y relative survival for
	breast cancer patients was lower (up to 13\%) in women 70-84 y of
	age compared to women aged 50-69 y, and the difference was most pronounced
	in stage IIB-III and in the unstaged. Significant differences in
	disease management were found, as older women had larger tumors,
	had fewer nodes examined, and did not receive treatment by radiotherapy
	or by chemotherapy as often as the younger women. Adjustment for
	diagnostic activity, tumor characteristics, and treatment diminished
	the relative excess mortality in stages III and in the unstaged,
	whereas the excess mortality was only marginally affected in stage
	IIB. CONCLUSIONS: Less diagnostic activity, less aggressive treatment,
	and later diagnosis in older women are associated with poorer survival.
	The large differences in treatment of older women are difficult to
	explain by co-morbidity alone.},

  abstract  = {PURPOSE: Despite a uniform regional breast cancer care program, breast
	cancer survival differs within regions. We therefore examined breast
	cancer survival in relation to differences in diagnostic activity,
	tumor characteristics, and treatment in seven Swedish counties within
	a single health care region. METHODS: We conducted a population-based
	observational study using a clinical breast cancer register in one
	Swedish health care region. Eligible women (n = 7,656) ages 40 to
	69 years diagnosed with primary breast cancer between 1992 and 2002
	were followed up until 2003. The 7-year relative survival ratio was
	used to estimate breast cancer survival. Excess mortality was modeled
	using Poisson regression to study differences in survival between
	counties. RESULTS: The 7-year relative survival for breast cancer
	patients was significantly lower (up to 7\% in absolute risk difference)
	in one county (county A) compared with the others. This difference
	existed only among women diagnosed before 1998, ages 50 to 59 years,
	and was strongest among stage II breast cancer patients. Adjustment
	for amount of diagnostic activity eliminated the survival differences
	among the counties. The amount of diagnostic activity was also lower
	in county A during the same time period. After county A, during 1997-1998,
	began to adhere strictly to the regional breast cancer care program,
	neither any survival differences nor diagnostic activity differences
	were observed. INTERPRETATIONS: Markers of diagnostic activity explained
	survival differences within our region, and the underlying mechanisms
	may be several. Low diagnostic activity may entail later diagnosis
	or inadequate characterization of the tumor and thereby missed treatment
	opportunities. Strengthening of multidisciplinary management of breast
	cancer can improve survival.},

	4,761 women 40-59 years of age and registered with primary breast

	and 2,3805 women without breast cancer. Information on socioeconomic

	5 years following the diagnosis. In Conditional Poisson Regression
	models, risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
	estimated to assess the impact of a breast cancer diagnosis.Three
	years after diagnosis, women who had had breast cancer more often
	had received sickness benefits (RR = 1.49, 95\% CI 1.40-1.58) or
	disability pension (RR = 1.47, 95\% CI 1.37-1.58) than had women
	without breast cancer. We found no effect on income (RR = 0.99),
	welfare payments (RR = 0.98), or marital status (RR = 1.02). A higher
	use of sickness benefits and disability pension was evident in all
	stages of the disease, although the difference in use of sickness
	benefits decreased after 5 years, whereas the difference in disability
	pension increased. For woman with early stage breast cancer, the
	sickness absence was higher following diagnosis among those with
	low education, who had undergone mastectomy, and had received chemo-
	or hormonal therapy. Neither tumour size nor presence of lymph nodes
	metastasis was associated with sickness absence after adjustment
	for treatment.Even in early stage breast cancer, a diagnosis negatively
	influences working capacity both 3 and 5 years after diagnosis, and
	it seems that the type of treatment received had the largest impact.

	Long-term (1975/1992-2010) and short-term (2001-2010) trends in age-adjusted
	incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading
	cancers among men and women were examined by joinpoint analysis.
	Through linkage with Medicare claims, the prevalence of comorbidity
	among cancer patients who were diagnosed between 1992 through 2005
	residing in 11 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
	areas were estimated and compared with the prevalence in a 5\% random

	survival and the probabilities of dying of their cancer and of other
	causes by comorbidity level, age, and stage were calculated.Death
	rates continued to decline for all cancers combined for men and women
	of all major racial and ethnic groups and for most major cancer sites;
	rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5\% per year from 2001
	through 2010. Overall incidence rates decreased in men and stabilized
	in women. The prevalence of comorbidity was similar among cancer-free
	Medicare beneficiaries (31.8\%), breast cancer patients (32.2\%),
	and prostate cancer patients (30.5\%); highest among lung cancer
	patients (52.9\%); and intermediate among colorectal cancer patients
	(40.7\%). Among all cancer patients and especially for patients diagnosed
	with local and regional disease, age and comorbidity level were important
	influences on the probability of dying of other causes and, consequently,
	on overall survival. For patients diagnosed with distant disease,
	the probability of dying of cancer was much higher than the probability
	of dying of other causes, and age and comorbidity had a smaller effect
	on overall survival.Cancer death rates in the United States continue
	to decline. Estimates of survival that include the probability of
	dying of cancer and other causes stratified by comorbidity level,

	serum creatinine for the first time and permanently exceeded 3.4
	mg/dl (men) or 2.8 mg/dl (women). A total of 926 cases (78\% of all

	estimated odds ratios (OR) as measures of relative risk for disease-specific
	types of CRF among smokers compared with never-smokers. Despite a
	modest and nonsignificant overall association, the risk increased
	with high daily doses (OR among smokers of >20 cigarettes/d, 1.51;

	Differences in response rates between responders to web and paper

  abstract    = {Inequalities in survival between rich and poor have been reported
	for most adult cancers in England. This study aims to quantify the
	public health impact of these inequalities by estimating the number
	of cancer-related deaths that would be avoidable if all patients
	were to have the same cancer survival as the most affluent patients.National
	Cancer Registry data for all adults diagnosed with one of 21 common
	cancers in England were used to estimate relative survival. We estimated
	the number of excess (cancer-related) deaths that would be avoidable
	within three years after diagnosis if relative survival for patients
	in all deprivation groups was as high as the most affluent group.For
	patients diagnosed during 2004-2006, 7122 of the 64,940 excess deaths
	a year (11\%) would have been avoidable if three-year survival for
	all patients had been as high as in the most affluent group. The
	annual number of avoidable deaths fell from 8435 (13\%) a year for
	patients diagnosed during 1996-2000. Over 60\% of the total number
	of avoidable deaths occurred within six months after diagnosis and
	approximately 70\% occurred in the two most deprived groups.The downward
	trend in the annual number of avoidable deaths reflects more an improvement
	in survival in England overall, rather than a narrowing of the deficit
	in cancer survival between poor and rich. The lack of any substantial
	change in the percentage of avoidable excess deaths highlights the
	persistent nature of the deficit in survival between affluent and
	deprived groups.},

  abstract    = {PURPOSE: Studies of cancer patient survival typically report relative
	survival or cause-specific survival using data from patients diagnosed
	many years in the past. From a risk-communication perspective, such
	measures are suboptimal for several reasons; their interpretation
	is not transparent for non-specialists, competing causes of death
	are ignored and the estimates are unsuitable to predict the outcome
	of newly diagnosed patients. In this paper, we discuss the relative
	merits of recently developed alternatives to traditionally reported
	measures of cancer patient survival. METHODS: In a relative survival
	framework, using a period approach, we estimated probabilities of
	death in the presence of competing risks. To illustrate the methods,
	we present estimates of survival among 23,353 initially untreated,
	or hormonally treated men with intermediate- or high-risk localized
	prostate cancer using Swedish population-based data. RESULTS: Among
	all groups of newly diagnosed patients, the probability of dying
	from prostate cancer, accounting for competing risks, was lower compared
	to the corresponding estimates where competing risks were ignored.
	Accounting for competing deaths was particularly important for patients
	aged more than 70 years at diagnosis in order to avoid overestimating
	the risk of dying from prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that
	period estimates of survival, accounting for competing risks, provide
	the tools to communicate the actual risk that cancer patients, diagnosed
	today, face to die from their disease. Such measures should offer
	a more useful basis for risk communication between patients and clinicians
	and we advocate their use as means to answer prognostic questions.},

	By simultaneously estimating the proportion of patients cured from
	colon cancer and the survival times of the 'uncured' we hope to increase
	understanding of how socioeconomic status affects survival following
	a diagnosis of colon cancer. METHODS: We conducted a population-based
	cohort study of 58,873 patients diagnosed with colon cancer in Sweden
	1965-2000. Socioeconomic status was classified based on occupation.
	We fitted mixture cure models and Poisson regression models adjusted
	for age, sex and calendar period. RESULTS: We observed higher excess
	mortality, lower proportion cured and shorter survival times among
	the uncured in patients from lower socioeconomic groups compared
	to the highest socioeconomic group. There was no evidence that the
	gap between the socioeconomic groups reduced over time. Farmers had
	the lowest odds of cure (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95\% confidence interval
	(CI) 0.75-0.95) compared to higher non-manual workers followed by
	self-employed (0.91, 0.81-1.03), manual workers (0.93, 0.85-1.03)
	and lower non-manual workers (0.98, 0.89-1.08). CONCLUSION: Patients
	from lower socioeconomic groups in Sweden experience worse survival
	following a diagnosis of colon cancer. Differences exist in both
	the cure proportion and the survival time of the uncured, suggesting
	that socioeconomic differences cannot be attributed solely to lead
	time bias.Although this study has furthered our understanding of
	socioeconomic differences in survival, more detailed studies are
	required in order to identify, and subsequently remove, the underlying
	reasons for the differences.},

	Despite their broad use in model selection, the foundations of the
	Akaike information criterion (AIC), the corrected Akaike criterion
	(AICc) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are, in general,
	poorly understood. The AIC, \{AICc\} and \{BIC\} penalize the likelihoods
	in order to select the simplest model. These criteria are based upon
	concepts of information and entropy, which are explained in this
	work, by focusing on a statistical approach. The three criteria are
	compared through Monte Carlo simulations, and the applications of
	these criteria are investigated in the selection of normal models,
	the selection of biological growth models and selection of time series
	models. For the simulation with normal models, all three criteria
	exhibited poor performance for a small sample size N = 100 (particularly,
	when the variances are slightly different). For biological growth
	model simulations with a very small sample size N = 13 the \{AIC\}
	and \{AICc\} showed better performance in comparison to the BIC.
	The simulation based on time series models produced results similar
	to the normal model simulations. For these simulations, the \{BIC\}
	exhibited superior performance, in some cases, in comparison to the
	other two information criteria (AIC and AICc) for a small sample
	size N = 100 , but in other cases, the \{BIC\} performed poorly,
	as did the \{AIC\} and AICc.},

  abstract    = {A growing proportion of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer
	detected through prostate-specific antigen testing are dying from
	causes other than prostate cancer. Temporal trends in specific causes
	of death among prostate cancer patients have not been well described.We
	analyzed causes of death among all incident prostate cancer cases
	recorded in the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry (1961-2008; n
	= 210 112) and in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
	Program (1973-2008; n = 490 341). We calculated the cumulative incidence
	of death due to seven selected causes that accounted for more than
	80\% of the reported deaths (including ischemic heart disease and
	non-prostate cancer) and analyzed mortality trends by calendar year
	and age at diagnosis and length of follow-up.During follow-up through
	2008, prostate cancer accounted for 52\% of all reported deaths in
	Sweden and 30\% of reported deaths in the United States among men
	with prostate cancer; however, only 35\% of Swedish men and 16\%
	of US men diagnosed with prostate cancer died from this disease.
	In both populations, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific
	death declined during follow-up, while the cumulative incidences
	of death from ischemic heart disease and non-prostate cancer remained
	constant. The 5-year cumulative incidence of death from prostate
	cancer among all men was 29\% in Sweden and 11\% in the United States.In
	Sweden and the United States, men diagnosed with prostate cancer
	are less likely to die from prostate cancer than from another cause.
	Because many of these other causes of death are preventable through
	changes in lifestyle, interventions that target lifestyle factors
	should be integrated into prostate cancer management.},

	curve to estimate such a safe dose level. Although such methods have
	attractive features, a low-dose extrapolation is highly dependent
	on the model choice. Fractional polynomials, basically being a set
	of (generalized) linear models, are a nice extension of classical
	polynomials, providing the necessary flexibility to estimate the
	dose-response curve. Typically, one selects the best-fitting model
	in this set of polynomials and proceeds as if no model selection
	were carried out. We show that model averaging using a set of fractional
	polynomials reduces bias and has better precision in estimating a
	safe level of exposure (say, the benchmark dose), as compared to
	an estimator from the selected best model. To estimate a lower limit
	of this benchmark dose, an approximation of the variance of the model-averaged
	estimator, as proposed by Burnham and Anderson, can be used. However,
	this is a conservative method, often resulting in unrealistically
	low safe doses. Therefore, a bootstrap-based method to more accurately
	estimate the variance of the model averaged parameter is proposed.},

	a key metric for cancer control. Unfortunately, such data typically
	contain a non-negligible proportion of missing values on important
	prognostic factors (eg, tumor stage).We carried out an empirical
	study to compare the performance of complete records analysis and
	several multiple imputation strategies when net survival is estimated
	via a flexible parametric proportional hazards model that includes
	stage, a partially observed categorical covariate. Starting from
	fully observed cancer registry data, we induced missingness on stage
	under three scenarios. For each of these scenarios, we simulated
	100 incomplete datasets and evaluated the performance of the different
	strategies.Ordinal logistic models are not suitable for the imputation
	of tumor stage. Complete records analysis may lead to grossly misleading
	estimates of net survival, even when the missing data mechanism is
	conditionally independent of survival time given the covariates and
	the bias on the excess hazard ratios estimates is negligible.As key
	covariates are unlikely missing completely at random, studies estimating
	net survival should not use complete records. When the missingness
	can be inferred from available data, appropriate multiple imputation
	should be performed. In the context of flexible parametric proportional
	hazards models with a partially observed stage covariate, a multinomial
	logistic imputation model for stage should be used and should include
	the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimate and the event indicator.},

	that these diseases also coaggregate in families. Methods: The authors
	investigated familial coaggregation of AD and PD by conducting a
	systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed was searched for relevant
	studies published through the end of October 2012. Three independent
	investigators screened publications and extracted data. Relative
	risk estimates of AD risk associated with family history of PD or
	parkinsonism, or PD risk associated with family history of AD or
	dementia, were summarized into metaestimates using random effects
	models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were tested using Higgins'
	and Egger's tests, respectively. Results: We included 16 studies
	in the review, with 14 included in any meta-analysis. AD risk associated
	with family history of PD yielded a summary hazard ratio of 1.18
	(95\% CI: 1.00-1.39) based on 5 reconstructed cohort studies and
	a summary odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 (95\% CI: 0.92-2.12) based on 7
	case-control studies. PD risk associated with family history of AD
	yielded a summary OR of 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.49-1.16) based on 3 studies.
	There was no significant heterogeneity among studies, nor significant
	publication bias. Conclusions: There may be familial coaggregation
	of AD and PD, although the association was modest and only apparent
	when studying AD risk associated with family history of PD.},

  abstract    = {Macrophages, upon encounter with micro-organisms or stimulated by
	cytokines, produce various effector molecules aimed at destroying
	the foreign agents and protecting the organism. Reactive oxygen species
	(ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are front line molecules
	exerting strong cytotoxic activities against micro-organisms and
	many cells, including macrophages themselves. Using cells of the
	murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) stimulated in vitro with
	lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or interferon (IFN-gamma), which induce
	strong endogenous NO production, we examined by which mechanisms
	a fraction of activated macrophages protect themselves from nitrosative
	stress and manage to escape destruction?We observed that survivors
	(10-50\% depending on the experiments) had acquired a resistant phenotype
	being capable to survive when further exposed in vitro to an apoptosis
	inducing dose of the NO donor compound DETA-NO. These cells expressed
	an increased steady-state levels of Mn SOD, CuZn SOD and catalase
	mRNA (130-200\%), together with an increased activity of the corresponding
	enzymes. Intracellular concentration of glutathione was also increased
	(x 3.5 fold at 6 hours, still maintained x 5.2 fold at 48 hours).
	Neither mRNA for glutathione peroxydase, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthase
	and glutathione reductase, nor thioredoxine and thioredoxine reductase,
	were significantly modified. Additional experiments in which RAW
	264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS and/or IFN-gamma in the presence
	of relatively specific inhibitors of both Mn and Cu/Zn SOD, aminotriazol
	(ATZ) catalase inhibitor and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) glutathione
	inhibitor, showed that inhibiting LPS-induced up-regulation of intracellular
	redox buffering systems also prevented acquisition of the resistant
	phenotype.Our data suggest a direct causal relationship between survival
	of a fraction of macrophages and a up-regulation of key sets of auto-protective
	intracellular redox buffering systems, occurring simultaneously with
	modulation of expression of apoptotic molecules of the Bcl2-Bcl-XL/Bax-Bad
	family.},

	of fixing Ro(inh), the evolution of any trait will affect trade-offs

	by using the mathematical concept of Lyapunov exponents. Altogether,
	we consider 960 different hypothetical "species" (i.e. different
	combinations of fixed traits). Corresponding ESSs are analyzed with
	respect to their age at first reproduction, adult survival and immature
	competitive ability components. They appear to be gathered in three
	groups. One is intuitive and characterized by a reduction of immature
	competitive ability and a correlation of age of maturity with adult
	survival; populations reach mainly equilibria. The two other groups
	respectively include "species" with low age of maturity but high
	adult survival, and "species" close to semelparity with delayed maturity;
	immature competitive ability may not be minimized, and populations
	possibly exhibit complex dynamics. In conclusion, the hypothesis
	that the evolution of a demographic parameter modifies trade-offs
	between others turns out to have important consequences. We argue
	that life history theory cannot ignore the source and mode-of-operation

	on the National Cancer Institute's SEER data, coupled with Medicare
	data, to estimate the probabilities of surviving or dying from cancer
	or from other causes based on a set of patient and tumor characteristics.
	The nomograms provide estimates of survival that are specific to
	the characteristics of the tumor, age, race, gender, and the overall
	health of a patient. These nomograms have been internally validated
	using the SEER data. In this paper, we externally validate the nomograms
	using data from Kaiser Permanente Colorado.The SEER Cancer Survival
	Calculator was externally validated using time-dependent area under
	the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve statistics and calibration
	plots for retrospective cohorts of 1102 prostate cancer and 990 colorectal
	cancer patients from Kaiser Permanente Colorado.The time-dependent
	area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve statistics
	were computed for one, three, five, seven, and 10 year(s) postdiagnosis
	for prostate and colorectal cancer and ranged from 0.77 to 0.89 for
	death from cancer and from 0.72 to 0.81 for death from other causes.
	The calibration plots indicated a very good fit of the model for
	death from cancer for colorectal cancer and for the higher risk group
	for prostate cancer. For the lower risk groups for prostate cancer
	(<10\% chance of dying of prostate cancer in 10 years), the model
	predicted slightly worse prognosis than observed. Except for the
	lowest risk group for colorectal cancer, the models for death from
	other causes for both prostate and colorectal cancer predicted slightly
	worse prognosis than observed.The results of the external validation
	indicated that the colorectal and prostate cancer nomograms are reliable
	tools for physicians and patients to use to obtain information on
	prognosis and assist in establishing priorities for both treatment
	of the cancer and other conditions, particularly when a patient is
	elderly and/or has significant comorbidities. The slightly better
	than predicted risk of death from other causes in a health maintenance
	organization (HMO) setting may be due to an overall healthier population
	and the integrated management of disease relative to the overall

  abstract    = {Cancer mortality statistics, an important indicator for monitoring
	cancer burden, are traditionally restricted to instances when cancer
	is determined to be the underlying cause of death (UCD) based on
	information recorded on standard certificates of death. This study's
	objective was to determine the impact of using multiple causes of
	death codes to compute site-specific cancer mortality statistics.The
	state cancer registries of California, Colorado and Idaho provided
	linked cancer registry and death certificate data for individuals
	who died between 2002 and 2004, had at least one cancer listed on
	their death certificate and were diagnosed with cancer between 1993
	and 2004. These linked data were used to calculate the site-specific
	proportion of cancers not selected as the UCD (non-UCD) among all
	cancer-related deaths (any mention on the death certificate). In
	addition, the retrospective concordance between the death certificate
	and the population-based cancer registry, measured as confirmations
	rates, was calculated for deaths with cancer as the UCD, as a non-UCD,
	and for any mention.Overall, non-UCD deaths comprised 9.5 percent
	of total deaths; 11 of the 79 cancer sites had proportions greater
	than 3 standard deviations from 9.5 percent. The confirmation rates
	for UCD and for any mention did not differ significantly for any
	of the cancer sites. CONCLUSION AND IMPACT: The site-specific variation
	in proportions and rates suggests that for a few cancer sites, death
	rates might be computed for both UCD and any mention of the cancer
	site on the death certificate. Nevertheless, this study provides
	evidence that, in general, restricting to UCD deaths will not under
	report cancer mortality statistics.},

	study of early-stage chronic renal failure in {S}weden, face-to-face
	interviews were conducted with 926 patients with newly diagnosed
	renal failure and 998 control subjects, of whom 918 and 980, respectively,
	had complete data. We used logistic-regression models to estimate
	the relative risks of disease-specific types of chronic renal failure
	associated with the use of various analgesics RESULTS: Aspirin and
	acetaminophen were used regularly by 37 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
	of the patients with renal failure and by 19 percent and 12 percent,
	respectively, of the controls. Regular use of either drug in the
	absence of the other was associated with an increase by a factor
	of 2.5 in the risk of chronic renal failure from any cause. The relative
	risks rose with increasing cumulative lifetime doses, rose more consistently
	with acetaminophen use than with aspirin use, and were increased
	for most disease-specific types of chronic renal failure. When we
	disregarded the recent use of analgesics, which could have occurred
	in response to antecedents of renal disease, the associations were
	only slightly attenuated CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent
	with the existence of exacerbating effects of acetaminophen and aspirin
	on chronic renal failure. However, we cannot rule out the possibility

	cAMP and the protein kinases Snf1 and Pho85 appear as major actors

	of the patient. In fact, classic survival indicators do not distinguish
	between patients who are cured, and patients who will die of their
	disease and in whom prolongation of survival is the main objective
	of treatment. In this study, we applied parametric cure models to
	the cancer incidence and follow-up data provided by 49 EUROCARE-4
	(European Cancer Registry-based study, fourth edition) cancer registries,
	with the aims of providing additional insights into the survival
	of European cancer patients diagnosed from 1988 to 1999, and of investigating
	between-population differences. Between-country estimates the proportion
	of cured patients varied from about 4-13\% for lung cancer, from
	9\% to 30\% for stomach cancer, from 25\% to 49\% for colon and rectum
	cancer, and from 55\% to 73\% for breast cancer. For all cancers
	combined, estimates varied between 21\% and 47\% in men, and 38\%
	and 59\% in women and were influenced by the distribution of cases
	by cancer site. Countries with high proportions of cured and long
	fatal case survival times for all cancers combined were characterised
	by generally favourable case mix. For the European pool of cases
	both the proportion of cured and the survival time of fatal cases
	were associated with age, and increased from the early to the latest
	diagnosis period. The increases over time in the proportions of Europeans
	estimated cured of lung, stomach and colon and rectum cancers are
	noteworthy and suggest genuine progress in cancer control. The proportion
	of cured of all cancers combined is a useful general indicator of
	cancer control as it reflects progress in diagnosis and treatment,

	covariates to affect the cause-specific relative hazards or to affect
	the absolute risk itself. An advantage of cause-specific relative

	relative risk and attributable risk, and these can be combined with
	registry data on age-specific composite hazard rates for the disease
	of interest and with national data on competing hazards of mortality
	to estimate absolute risk. Family-based designs, such as the kin-cohort
	design and collections of pedigrees with multiple affected individuals
	can be used to estimate the genotype-specific hazard of disease.
	Such analyses must be adjusted for ascertainment, and failure to
	take into account residual familial risk, such as might be induced
	by unmeasured genetic variants or by unmeasured behavioral or environmental
	exposures that are correlated within families, can lead to overestimates

	data become available in Europe, providing an opportunity to compare
	survival in Europe and the United States. METHODS: The authors considered
	12 cancers: lung, breast, stomach, colon, rectum, melanoma, cervix
	uteri, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, Hodgkin disease, and non-Hodgkin
	lymphoma. The authors analyzed 738,076 European and 282,398 U.S.
	patients, whose disease was diagnosed in 1985-1989, obtained from
	41 EUROCARE cancer registries in 17 countries and 9 U.S. SEER registries.
	Relative survival was estimated to correct for competing causes of
	mortality. RESULTS: Europeans had significantly lower survival rates
	than U.S. patients for most cancers. Differences in 5-year relative
	survival rates were higher for prostate (56\% vs. 81\%), skin melanoma
	(76\% vs. 86\%), colon (47\% vs. 60\%), rectum (43\% vs. 57\%), breast
	(73\% vs. 82\%), and corpus uteri (73\% vs. 83\%). Survival declined
	with increasing age at diagnosis for most cancers in both the U.S.
	and Europe but was more marked in Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Survival for
	most major cancers was worse in Europe than the U.S. especially for
	older patients. Differences in data collection, analysis, and quality
	apparently had only marginal influences on survival rate differences.
	Further research is required to clarify the reasons for the survival
	rate differences.},

  abstract    = {Using parametric models, a procedure for projecting survival estimates
	beyond the follow-up limits of a clinical trial is developed. The
	methodology consists of fitting an appropriate parametric model to
	the tail of a survival curve and using the estimated model in conjunction
	with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate to produce a composite
	survival-function estimator. This estimator is especially useful
	whenever a parametric model is more easily fit to the tail rather
	than to the entire survival curve. Probability plots are used to
	evaluate different parametric models as well as to determine appropriate
	values for the cut points that define the survival-function tail.
	The bootstrap method provides estimates of variation in the projected
	survival curve. The resulting projected survival estimates allow
	one to make inferences on long-term treatment effects in clinical
	trials. As a motivating application, we project survival curves to
	estimate long-term treatment effects on quality-of-life-adjusted
	survival. This represents an extension of a statistical procedure
	called Q-TWiST (Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease
	and Toxicity of treatment), which evaluates treatments in terms of
	both quantity and quality of life. In a standard Q-TWiST analysis,
	the average time spent in each of a number of health states, which
	differ in quality of life, is estimated from clinical trial data.
	The health states are weighted according to the quality of life experienced,
	and the results are combined to produce an estimate of quality-adjusted
	survival. Such estimates, however, are restricted to the follow-up
	limit of the data. The way in which the extrapolation methodology
	provides longer range estimates of Q-TWiST is described. To illustrate
	the techniques, we apply the methodology to data from the International
	Breast Cancer Study Group Trial V, which compares long-duration adjuvant
	chemotherapy versus short-duration chemotherapy in the treatment
	of node-positive breast cancer. Five-year median follow-up data are
	used to predict 10-year results in terms of mean survival and mean
	Q-TWiST. The results indicate that patients continue to benefit greatly

  abstract    = {Summary The standard estimator for the cause-specific cumulative incidence
	function in a competing risks setting with left truncated and/or
	right censored data can be written in two alternative forms. One
	is a weighted empirical cumulative distribution function and the
	other a product-limit estimator. This equivalence suggests an alternative
	view of the analysis of time-to-event data with left truncation and
	right censoring: individuals who are still at risk or experienced
	an earlier competing event receive weights from the censoring and
	truncation mechanisms. As a consequence, inference on the cumulative
	scale can be performed using weighted versions of standard procedures.
	This holds for estimation of the cause-specific cumulative incidence
	function as well as for estimation of the regression parameters in
	the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model. We
	show that, with the appropriate filtration, a martingale property
	holds that allows deriving asymptotic results for the proportional
	subdistribution hazards model in the same way as for the standard
	Cox proportional hazards model. Estimation of the cause-specific
	cumulative incidence function and regression on the subdistribution
	hazard can be performed using standard software for survival analysis
	if the software allows for inclusion of time-dependent weights. We
	show the implementation in the R statistical package. The proportional
	subdistribution hazards model is used to investigate the effect of
	calendar period as a deterministic external time varying covariate,
	which can be seen as a special case of left truncation, on AIDS related
	and non-AIDS related cumulative mortality.},

	(a) screening for type 2 diabetes to enable early detection and treatment,
	(b) screening for type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance,
	intervening with lifestyle interventions in those with a diagnosis
	of impaired glucose tolerance to delay or prevent diabetes, (c) as
	for (b) but with pharmacological interventions, and (d) no screening.
	DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on development and evaluation
	of probabilistic, comprehensive economic decision analytic model,
	from screening to death. SETTING: A hypothetical population, aged
	45 at time of screening, with above average risk of diabetes. DATA
	SOURCES: Published clinical trials and epidemiological studies retrieved
	from electronic bibliographic databases; supplementary data obtained
	from the Department of Health statistics for England and Wales, the
	screening those at risk (STAR) study, and the Leicester division
	of the ADDITION study. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model
	was developed to simulate the long term effects of each screening
	strategy, in terms of both clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes.
	The base case model assumed a 50 year time horizon with discounting
	of both costs and benefits at 3.5\%. Sensitivity analyses were carried
	out to investigate assumptions of the model and to identify which
	model inputs had most impact on the results. RESULTS: Estimated costs
	for each quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (discounted at
	3.5\% a year for both costs and benefits) were pound14,150 (euro17
	560; $27,860) for screening for type 2 diabetes, pound6242 for screening
	for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance followed by lifestyle
	interventions, and pound7023 for screening for diabetes and impaired
	glucose tolerance followed by pharmacological interventions, all
	compared with no screening. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of
	pound20,000 the probability of the intervention being cost effective
	was 49\%, 93\%, and 85\% for each of the active screening strategies
	respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for type 2 diabetes and impaired
	glucose tolerance, with appropriate intervention for those with impaired
	glucose tolerance, in an above average risk population aged 45, seems
	to be cost effective. The cost effectiveness of a policy of screening
	for diabetes alone, which offered no intervention to those with impaired
	glucose tolerance, is still uncertain.},

	study was to show how the creation and formalization of a network
	comprising established research teams, which already had substantial
	and complementary experience in both cancer survival analysis and
	methodological development, make it possible to meet challenges and
	thus provide more adequate tools, to improve the quality and the

	researchers highly skilled in biostatistics, methodology, and epidemiology,
	from different research organizations in France, the United Kingdom,
	Italy, Slovenia, and Canada, and involved in French (FRANCIM) and
	European (EUROCARE) cancer registry networks. The expected advantages
	are an interdisciplinary, international, synergistic network capable
	of addressing problems in public health, for decision-makers at different

	methodology that makes unbiased cross-national comparisons of cancer
	survival feasible; transfer of methods for net survival estimations
	to other specific applications (clinical research, occupational epidemiology);
	and dissemination of results during an international training course.
	The formalization of the international CENSUR working survival group
	was motivated by a need felt by scientists conducting population-based
	cancer research to discuss, develop, and monitor implementation of
	a common methodology to analyze net survival in order to provide
	useful information for cancer control and cancer policy. A "team

	provides an estimate of patients' survival, allowing for the effects

	models are commonly used in population-based studies to model the

	Most often, studies focus on routinely collected prognostic factors
	for which the proportion of missing values is usually low (around
	5 per cent). However, in some cases, additional factors are collected
	with a greater proportion of missingness. In the present article,
	we systematically assess the performance of multiple imputation in
	regression analysis of relative survival through a series of simulation
	experiments. According to the assumptions concerning the missingness
	mechanism (completely at random, at random, and not at random) and
	the missingness pattern (monotone, non-monotone), several strategies
	were considered and compared: all cases analysis, complete cases
	analysis, missing data indicator analysis, and multiple imputation
	by chained equations (MICE) analysis. We showed that MICE performs
	well in estimating the hazard ratios and the baseline hazard function
	when the missing mechanism is missing at random (MAR) conditionally
	on the vital status. In the situations where the missing mechanism
	was not MAR conditionally on vital status, complete case behaves
	consistently. As illustration, we used data of the French Cancer
	Registries on relative survival of patients with colorectal cancer.

  abstract    = {Relative survival is a method used to estimate net survival using
	the expected mortality in the general population. This method is
	frequently used in cancer registries, more particularly with the
	Esteve et al. regressive proportional hazards model. Recently, extensions
	of this model have been developed to account for time-dependent covariate
	and for time-dependent hazards using B-spline functions. We propose
	a function, RSurv, to take into account these extensions. Written
	in the R/S language this function has the same structure of the standard
	Cox function coxph of R and S-PLUS software with the goal to homogenise
	survival functions and to take advantages of the power of R and S-PLUS
	software. We also propose a function, plot.RSurv, for plotting relative
	survival curves and time-dependent hazards ratio. The usage of these
	functions is exemplified by a study of a breast cancer hospital-based
	data set.},

	component in the evaluation of cancer control, but subject to an
	inherent delay in the reporting of the most recent survival estimates
	with traditional techniques of analysis. METHODS: We examined survival
	trends between the years 2000 and 2004 for 20 common cancers based
	on follow-up data from 12 cancer registries from diverse areas of
	Europe using model-based period analysis techniques. RESULTS: Between
	2000 and 2004, marked rises were seen in 5-year relative survival
	amongst patients with prostate, breast and colorectal cancer, which
	were statistically significant in 10, 8 and 7 of the 12 participating
	cancer registries, respectively. For cancer sites amenable to effective
	early detection and treatment, major geographical differences in
	patient prognosis still persisted, with a lower survival generally
	observed in Eastern European countries. CONCLUSION: Model-based period
	analysis enables the timely monitoring of recent trends in population-based
	cancer survival. For colorectal and breast cancers, the identified
	rises in survival are probably (at least partly) explained by the
	improvements in clinical care and the management of the disease.
	Nevertheless, persisting geographic differences do point to the potential
	for a further reduction in the burden of cancer throughout Europe,
	towards which improvements in diverse areas of care, including secondary
	prevention, access to advances in treatment as well as subspecialisation
	and regionalisation of oncologic care may all contribute.},

	transitions between various states of sickness absence and work over
	time. In this paper we study a cohort of work rehabilitation participants
	and analyse their subsequent sickness absence using Norwegian registry
	data on sickness benefits. Our aim is to study how detailed individual
	covariate information from questionnaires explain differences in
	sickness absence and work, and to use methods from causal inference
	to assess the effect of interventions to reduce sickness absence.
	Examples of the latter are to evaluate the use of partial versus
	full time sick leave and to estimate the effect of a cooperation
	agreement on a more inclusive working life.Covariate adjusted transition
	intensities are estimated using Cox proportional hazards and Aalen
	additive hazards models, while the effect of interventions are assessed
	using methods of inverse probability weighting and G-computation.Results
	from covariate adjusted analyses show great differences in sickness
	absence and work for patients with assumed high risk and low risk
	covariate characteristics, for example based on age, type of work,
	income, health score and type of diagnosis. Causal analyses show
	small effects of partial versus full time sick leave and a positive
	effect of having a cooperation agreement, with about 5 percent points
	higher probability of returning to work.Detailed covariate information
	is important for explaining transitions between different states
	of sickness absence and work, also for patient specific cohorts.
	Methods for causal inference can provide the needed tools for going
	from covariate specific estimates to population average effects in
	multi-state models, and identify causal parameters with a straightforward
	interpretation based on interventions.},

  abstract  = {Epidemiologic studies often encounter missing covariate values. While
	simple methods such as stratification on missing-data status, conditional-mean
	imputation, and complete-subject analysis are commonly employed for
	handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods
	can be biased under reasonable circumstances. The authors review
	these results in the context of logistic regression and present simulation
	experiments showing the limitations of the methods. The method based
	on missing-data indicators can exhibit severe bias even when the
	data are missing completely at random, and regression (conditional-mean)
	imputation can be inordinately sensitive to model misspecification.
	Even complete-subject analysis can outperform these methods. More
	sophisticated methods, such as maximum likelihood, multiple imputation,
	and weighted estimating equations, have been given extensive attention
	in the statistics literature. While these methods are superior to
	simple methods, they are not commonly used in epidemiology, no doubt
	due to their complexity and the lack of packaged software to apply
	these methods. The authors contrast the results of multiple imputation
	to simple methods in the analysis of a case-control study of endometrial
	cancer, and they find a meaningful difference in results for age
	at menarche. In general, the authors recommend that epidemiologists
	avoid using the missing-indicator method and use more sophisticated
	methods whenever a large proportion of data are missing.},

  volume      = {10 Suppl 1},
  abstract    = {Epidemiological studies have identified high heart rates as a risk
	factor for coronary heart disease mortality, and heart rate was found
	to correlate with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Heart
	rate was positively correlated with serum concentrations of total
	cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol. Since heart
	rate responds sensitively to sympathoadrenergic activity, it was
	hypothesized that catecholamines play a crucial role in the unfavorable
	lipid alterations. In addition to influences on circulating lipids,
	the question arose whether catecholamines have more specific effects
	on molecular species of structural lipids. Of particular importance
	is the question of the involvement of catecholamines in the recently
	suggested correlation between arachidonic acid and stroke mortality.
	It is therefore attempted to delineate the possible effects of catecholamines
	on the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids of heart muscle
	and vasculature. This was achieved in rats by either catecholamine
	injection or by swimming, a condition known to be associated with
	marked sympatho-adrenergic stimulation. In swimming rats, linoleic
	acid was decreased by up to 40\% in heart phospholipids, whereas
	stearic acid and arachidonic acid were increased. Similarly, chronic
	norepinephrine treatment in rats resulted in a net decrease in linoleic
	acid and an increase in arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid,
	which was particularly pronounced when rats were fed an n-3 polyunsaturated
	fatty acid (PUFA)-rich oil diet. Thus, catecholamines do affect the
	PUFA composition of heart membranes, mainly through an increase in
	arachidonic acid content. To further define the action of catecholamines
	on structural lipids, isolated rat ventricular myocytes in culture
	were subjected four times to 30 minutes of isoproterenol (10(-6)
	M) stimulation over 48 hours. No changes in membrane lipid parameters
	were observed, although the beating rate was increased by 30\% during
	the stimulation. When the cell membranes were enriched in n-3 PUFAs
	(in association with a decrease in arachidonic acid), the positive
	chronotropic effect elicited by isoproterenol was raised to + 50\%,
	indicating the modulation of adrenergic function by membrane PUFAs.
	However, isoproterenol treatment again had no effect on the phospholipid
	fatty acid composition. Thus, the effect of catecholamines on membrane
	lipids observed in intact organism appears to be indirect and to
	involve most probably organs such as the liver and adipose tissue.
	Catecholamines are expected to induce a lipolysis-linked quantitative
	and qualitative alteration in circulating fatty acids, which in turn
	alter the heart membrane composition, similar to the composition
	changes elicited by diet lipid alterations. Since there is increasing
	evidence that such fatty acid changes affect the activity of membrane
	proteins, the possibility emerges that this mechanism may contribute
	to the catecholamine-linked cardiovascular mortality.},

	countries to reach stable age distributions. The individual populations
	by sex and age were projected for 150 years in 5-year intervals with
	the present constant mortality and fertility schedules by component
	method. Observations have been made by considering the following
	characteristics of population when it has acquired stability: age
	distribution; the rate of growth, birthrate, and mortality rate;
	the population change; the intrinsic rate of growth, birthrate and
	mortality rate; and approximate time taken to stabilize the population.
	The initial age distribution has a significant part in the amount
	of time it takes for a population to acquire stability, and its intrinsic
	rate of growth is mostly dependent upon the existing age distribution
	of that population. The time taken for a country's population to
	become stable depends upon the age distribution, fertility and mortality
	schedules at the beginning. It has been observed that countries having
	a higher intrinsic rate of growth take comparatively less time in
	acquiring stability than the countries having a lower intrinsic rate
	of growth. The mortality and fertility schedules of a country is
	another important phenomenon. The populations of the different countries
	at the point of stability were growing according to their rates of
	growth. No specific trend of population growth could be found among
	the groups of countries. Time taken for stabilizing the population
	is completely based upon age distributions, fertility and mortality
	schedules a particular country was having at the beginning. The range
	of time taken for different countries to acquire stability generally
	ranged from 100 to 135 years. Among the different countries the relationship
	for the time it takes to acquire stability has not been established.

	Results. Record linkages between the NPCR and the Swedish Cancer
	Registry, the Cause of Death Register and the Register of the Total
	Population generated a database, named PCBaSe Sweden, including 80
	079 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed between 1 January 1996 and 31

  abstract  = {Survival from cancer over a certain time period is often measured
	by the 'relative survival rate'. This is the ratio of the observed

	in a group of people in the general population, who are similar to
	the patients with respect to all of the possible factors affecting
	survival at the beginning of the period, except for the disease under
	study. When patterns of patient withdrawal differ for a number of
	subgroups of patients with equal relative survival rates, the current
	method of derivation of the relative survival rate is biased. A method
	based on the concept of an 'expected life table' is proposed for
	removal of the bias. Examples based on material from the Finnish

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: The methods on how to calculate cumulative relative survival
	have been ambiguous and have given differences in empirical results.
	METHODS: The gold standard for the cumulative relative survival ratio
	is the weighted average of age-specific cumulative relative survival
	ratios, with weights proportional to numbers of patients at diagnosis.
	Mathematics and representative empirical materials from the population-based
	Finnish Cancer Registry were studied for the different relative survival
	methods and compared with the gold standard. RESULTS: The theoretical
	and empirical results show a good agreement between the method suggested
	in 1959 by Ederer and Heise (the so-called Ederer II method) and
	the gold standard. This result is in part due the fact that as follow-up
	time increases the conditional (annual) relative survival ratios
	become increasingly more independent of age. Moreover, the dependence
	between the excess mortality due to cancer and the baseline general
	mortality does not introduce an important enough selection in practice
	to cause a notable bias. CONCLUSION: The use of the method by Ederer
	and Heise, multiplication of the annual relative survival ratios,
	instead of direct standardisation, should be considered in future
	applications. This would be particularly important for the long-term
	follow-up when age-specific relative survival is not available in
	the oldest age categories.},

	tested the protective value of impregnated dog collars (20 g plastic
	containing deltamethrin 800 mg ai) against Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli)
	sandflies in Iran. For each assay, the dog was sedated and caged
	in a net with 70-100 wild-caught sandflies overnight (23.30-06.30
	hours). Dogs wearing the collars were bitten by approximately 80\%
	fewer sandflies than before collars were fitted, i.e. 51\% vs. 11\%
	of hungry female flies exposed. Sandfly mortality rates following
	20 h exposure to dogs with collars (18\%) or without collars (17\%)
	were not significantly different. Effects of collars were tested
	when dogs had been wearing them for 8 days. A previous trial against
	the sandfly P. perniciosus Newstead in France, using smaller dogs,
	showed that effects of such collars were not fully realized until
	they had been worn for 2 weeks or more; they remained effective for
	at least 8 months and killed significant proportions of the sandflies
	exposed. Present results with P. papatasi, confirming that this simple
	device provides effective protection against sandflies, are considered
	sufficiently encouraging to justify a community-wide field trial
	of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars against ZVL vector sandflies

	normotensive and 24 preeclamptic women who were similar in age, weight,
	and mean duration of gestation (35 weeks) were studied. Diurnal variation
	and BP measurement were assessed using ambulatory BP monitors validated

	women than in normotensive women. The day-night BP difference decreased
	as average BP rose (diastolic gradient = -0.54 [95\% confidence interval

	Drug Administration in 1986 to monitor the disease status in patients
	with prostate cancer and, in 1994, to aid in prostate cancer detection.
	However, after 1986, the test was performed on many men who had not
	been previously diagnosed with prostate cancer, apparently resulting
	in the diagnosis of a substantial number of early tumors. Our purpose
	is to provide insight into the effect of screening on prostate cancer
	rates. Detailed data are presented for whites because the size of
	the population allows for calculating statistically reliable rates;
	however, similar overall trends are seen for African-Americans and
	other races.Prostate cancer incidence data from the National Cancer
	Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and
	mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics were
	analyzed.The following findings are consistent with a screening effect:
	1) the recent decrease since 1991 in the incidence of distant stage
	disease, after not having been perturbed by screening; 2) the decline
	in the incidence of earlier stage disease beginning the following
	year (i.e., 1992); 3) the recent increases and decreases in prostate
	cancer incidence and mortality by age that appear to indicate a calendar
	period effect; and 4) trends in the incidence of distant stage disease
	by tumor grade and trends in the survival of patients with distant
	stage disease by calendar year that provide suggestive evidence of
	the tendency of screening to detect slower growing tumors.The decline
	in the incidence of distant stage disease holds the promise that
	testing for prostate-specific antigen may lead to a sustained decline
	in prostate cancer mortality. However, population data are complex,

	of a lack of accurate quantitative information and of a high variability
	of the virus. The level of specific herd immunity towards epidemic
	strains is an important factor of prevision. As far as mortality
	is concerned, there is a net and regular increase of risk up from
	the age of 45. In addition to elderly, other high risk categories
	are known such as patients suffering of a number of organic deficiences
	or chronical conditions, pregnant women and children. The best evaluation
	of efficacy of vaccines is the study of incidence reduction in a
	vaccinated group in comparison to unvaccinated controls. Present
	vaccines are really efficient to reduce the risk of getting the disease,
	except in the case of an antigenic shift, which means the activity
	of a new antigenic component. These advantages are to be weighted
	to the small risk of vaccine reactions, which are not frequent and
	usually benign. Several vaccination strategies can be used. In France,
	it has been decided to recommand vaccine to priority groups: people
	over 65 and deficient patients. This policy is eqlivalent in many
	western countries (West Europe, USA); it is not efficient in preventing

	transmission category, sex, diagnosis year, CD4 count, and by county-level
	SES variables from the U.S. Census. Data, from the national HIV/AIDS
	Reporting System, were for HIV-infected persons ages > or =13 years
	(diagnosis during 1996-2003 and follow-up through 2005). We calculated
	RS proportions by using a maximum likelihood algorithm and modeled
	the relative risk of excess death (RR) using generalized linear models,
	with poverty as a random effect. RESULTS: For men, RS was worse in
	counties with larger proportions of people living below the 2000
	U.S. poverty level (87.7\% for poverty of > or =20\% vs. 90.1\% for
	poverty of <5.0\%) and where unemployment was greater (87.8\% where
	unemployment > 7.1\% vs. 90.5\% where unemployment < 4.0\%). The
	effects of county-level SES on RS of women were similar. In multilevel
	multivariate models, RR for men and women within 5 years after an
	HIV diagnosis was significantly worse in counties where 10.0-19.9\%
	(compared with <5.0\%) lived below the poverty level (RR = 1.3 [95\%
	CI 1.2-1.5] and RR = 1.8 [95\% CI 1.4-2.2], respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
	RS was worse in lower SES areas. To help address the impact of county-level
	SES, resources for HIV testing, care, and proven economic interventions
	should be directed to areas with concentrations of economically disadvantaged

	prognosis is improving, a growing number of women are at risk of
	developing bilateral disease. Little is known, however, about incidence
	trends and prognostic features of bilateral breast cancer. PATIENTS
	AND METHODS: Among 123,757 women with a primary breast cancer diagnosed
	in Sweden from 1970 to 2000, a total of 6,550 developed bilateral
	breast cancer. We separated synchronous (diagnosed within 3 months
	after a first breast cancer) and metachronous bilateral cancer, and
	analyzed incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer using Poisson
	regression models. RESULTS: The incidence of synchronous breast cancer
	increased by age and by 40\% during the 1970s, whereas the incidence
	of metachronous cancer decreased by age and by approximately 30\%
	since the early 1980s, most likely due to increasing use of adjuvant
	therapy. Women who developed bilateral cancer within 5 years and
	at age younger than 50 years were 3.9 times (95\% CI, 3.5 to 4.5)
	more likely to die as a result of breast cancer than women with unilateral
	cancer. Women with a bilateral cancer diagnosed more than 10 years
	after the first cancer had a prognosis similar to that of a unilateral
	breast cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy of primary cancer is a predictor
	of poor survival after diagnosis of early metachronous cancers. CONCLUSION:
	We found profound differences in the incidence trends and prognostic
	outlook between synchronous and metachronous bilateral breast cancer
	diagnosed at different ages. Adjuvant chemotherapy therapy has a
	dual effect on metachronous cancer: it reduces the risk, while at
	the same time it seems to worsen the prognosis.},

	using epidemiological methods. A questionnaire was mailed to all
	431 living prostate cancer patients aged 50-80 at the time of selection,
	diagnosed 1.5-2 years previously in Stockholm County, and 435 randomly
	selected men in the same age group. The questionnaire was completed
	anonymously. The main outcome measures included questions assessing
	the extent to which the men could share emotionally taxing feelings
	with their partner or others and questions assessing well-being.
	RESULTS: The questionnaire was returned by 79\% of the patients and
	by 73\% of the randomly selected men. Approximately one in five patients
	had no one to confide in. Of patients living with a partner, only
	one in 10 confided in someone other than their partner. Three out
	of 10 patients living in a relationship could not confide in their
	partner. Men having no one to confide in were less content with their
	life and reported poorer psychological and overall well-being compared
	with other men. The prostate cancer patients were not more likely
	to have someone to confide in than men in general. CONCLUSIONS: The
	results indicate that a lack of emotional support may be a problem
	for many prostate cancer patients and that the traditional psychosocial
	support offered to most cancer patients in {S}weden may not reach
	male patients. There may be a need for a gender-adapted approach

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: To study the excess prevalence of distressful symptoms
	after radical surgery for urinary bladder cancer. METHODS: We included
	all patients who underwent cystectomy due to bladder cancer before
	1996 in Stockholm County. A control group was randomly selected from
	the general population. Information was collected by means of an
	anonymous postal questionnaire. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires
	were returned by 310 (71\%) controls and 251 (85\%) cystectomized
	individuals. A 5-fold (reservoir) and 9-fold (conduit) increase in
	defecation urgency and a 4-fold (reservoir) and 6-fold (conduit)
	increase in faecal leakage were reported in individuals operated
	on. Urinary tract infection was increased 3-fold in cystectomized
	individuals compared with controls, during the previous year 26\%
	of the patients reported a symptomatic infection. The perception
	of a reduced physical attractiveness due to disease was more than
	5-fold increased in the men operated on compared to the controls.
	The majority, 135 out of 201 (67\%), reported that they would have
	refused alternative bladder-sparing procedures if they decreased
	the prospects of survival by even as little as 1\%. CONCLUSIONS:
	The patient's situation after cystectomy is considerably impaired
	due to changed bowel and sexual function, urinary tract infections
	and a sense of decreased attractiveness. However, most patients are
	in spite of this unwilling to compromise survival.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Radical radiotherapy for muscle-invasive urinary bladder
	cancer can sterilize the tumour with preserved organ function. Here
	we studied symptoms, symptom distress and trade-off among long-term
	survivors and compared figures to those of population controls and
	patients who had undergone cystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
	identified 71 patients who had had urinary bladder cancer treated
	with radical radiotherapy before 1995. For comparison, 325 patients
	treated with radical cystectomy and urostomy, continent or non-continent,
	during the same period and 460 individuals randomly selected from
	the general population were included. Information was collected by
	means of an anonymously answered postal questionnaire to avoid investigator-related
	bias. RESULTS: Answers were obtained from 58 (82\%) radiated patients,
	251 (85\%) cystectomized patients and 310 (71\%) population controls.
	Of the radiated patients, 74\% reported little or no distress from
	symptoms from the urinary tract, 38\% had had intercourse the previous
	month and 57\% (men) reported they had ejaculated. Among the cystectomized
	patients, 13\% had had intercourse and 0\% (men) had ejaculated.
	Moderate or much distress from symptoms from the gastrointestinal
	tract was reported by 32\% of the radiated patients, 24\% of the
	cystectomized patients and 9\% of the population controls. After
	radical radiotherapy, 46\% of the patients were willing to accept
	some risk of decreased survival to become symptom-free. CONCLUSIONS:
	About 3/4 of these long-term survivors after radical radiotherapy
	for bladder cancer had a functioning urinary bladder with little
	or no distress from the urinary tract. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction
	was lower than after cystectomy and the prevalence of distress from
	the gastrointestinal tract was comparable.},

	had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. METHODS:
	Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated
	the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized
	trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of
	"trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or
	noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. RESULTS: The ITT hazard
	ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus
	noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92-2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96
	(0.78-1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61-1.14)
	in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84-1.48) in the
	others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are
	similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the
	ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated
	adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The
	HRs were 1.61 (0.97-2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66-1.49)
	for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19-1.51) in women
	within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78-1.84) in others (P
	value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between
	these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between
	the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates
	could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of
	time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

  abstract    = {For the analysis of time trends in incidence and mortality rates,
	the age-period-cohort (apc) model has became a widely accepted method.
	The considered data are arranged in a two-way table by age group
	and calendar period, which are mostly subdivided into 5- or 10-year
	intervals. The disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information
	by data aggregation and the problems of estimating interactions in
	the two-way layout without replications. In this article we show
	how splines can be useful when yearly data, i.e., 1-year age groups
	and 1-year periods, are given. The estimated spline curves are still
	smooth and represent yearly changes in the time trends. Further,
	it is straightforward to include interaction terms by the tensor
	product of the spline functions. If the data are given in a nonrectangular
	table, e.g., 5-year age groups and 1-year periods, the period and
	cohort variables can be parameterized by splines, while the age variable
	is parameterized as fixed effect levels, which leads to a semiparametric
	apc model. An important methodological issue in developing the nonparametric
	and semiparametric models is stability of the estimated spline curve
	at the boundaries. Here cubic regression splines will be used, which
	are constrained to be linear in the tails. Another point of importance
	is the nonidentifiability problem due to the linear dependency of
	the three time variables. This will be handled by decomposing the
	basis of each spline by orthogonal projection into constant, linear,
	and nonlinear terms, as suggested by Holford (1983, Biometrics 39,
	311-324) for the traditional apc model. The advantage of using splines
	for yearly data compared to the traditional approach for aggregated
	data is the more accurate curve estimation for the nonlinear trend
	changes and the simple way of modeling interactions between the time
	variables. The method will be demonstrated with hypothetical data
	as well as with cancer mortality data.},

  abstract    = {Background: Relative survival is an extensively used method in population
	based cancer studies as it provides a measure of survival without
	the need for accurate cause of death information. It gives an estimate
	for the probability of dying from cancer in the absence of other
	causes by estimating the excess mortality in the study population
	when compared to an external group. The external group is usually
	the general population within a country or state and mortality estimates
	are taken from national life tables that are broken down by age,
	sex, calendar year and, where applicable, race/ethnicity. One potential
	bias when using relative survival that is most often overlooked occurs
	when there are a high proportion of deaths due to a specific cancer
	in the external group. Methods: This paper uses data from the Finnish
	Cancer Registry to illustrate, through the use of a simple sensitivity
	analysis, the impact that specific cancer deaths in the population
	mortality figures can have on the estimate of relative survival.
	Results: We found that when examining specific diseases such as breast
	cancer and colon cancer, the proportion of deaths due to these specific
	cancers in the general population is so small in comparison to the
	total mortality that they make little difference to the relative
	survival estimates. However, prostate cancer proved to be an exception
	to this. For all cancer sites combined the sensitivity analysis illustrates
	a major limitation for this type of analysis, particularly with the
	older age groups. Conclusion: We recommend that, with a classification
	of diseases as wide as all cancer sites, relative survival should
	not be used without appropriate adjustment.},

	care. We present an analysis using competing risks methodology which
	allows the simultaneous modelling of babies who die in neonatal care
	and those who survive to discharge.Data were obtained on 2723 babies
	born at 24-28 weeks gestational age in 2006-10 and admitted to neonatal
	care. Death and discharge alive are two mutually exclusive events
	and can be treated as competing risks. A flexible parametric modelling
	approach was used to analyse these two competing events and obtain
	estimates of the absolute probabilities of death or discharge.The
	absolute probabilities of death or discharge are presented in graphical
	form showing the cause-specific cumulative incidence over time by
	gender, gestational age and birthweight. The discharge of babies
	alive generally occurred over a longer time period for babies of
	lower gestational age and smaller birthweight than for bigger babies.This
	study has presented a useful statistical method for modelling the
	length of stay where there are significant rates of in-unit mortality.
	In health care systems that are increasingly focusing on costs and
	resource planning, it is essential to consider not only length of

  volume    = {25},
  abstract  = {For more than a century, a role for wound healing in the outgrowth
	of tumours has been implied based on observations in both experimental
	and clinical studies. Wound healing can be divided into stages of
	inflammatory, proliferative, repair and remodelling processes. Through
	proper regulation of activation of epithelial, endothelial and inflammatory
	cells, platelets and fibroblasts, and the production of growth factors,
	wounds heal and the various cell types resume their normal function.
	In tumour growth, similar processes of cell activation and growth
	factor production are observed. These processes are, however, differently
	regulated leading to ongoing cellular activation. In recent years,
	growth factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, bFGF, IGF I and
	II, and PDGF have been identified to play a role in the different
	stages of wound healing. In addition, some of these factors have
	now been identified as also being involved in the outgrowth of tumours.
	In this review, cell types involved in wound healing and tumour growth,
	as well as the growth factors and cytokines they produce and the
	role of the extracellular matrix, extensively present in both conditions,
	are being discussed. A better understanding of the time interval
	during which the sequelae of events in wound healing occur in relation
	to the time interval of tumour recurrence may be the basis for defining
	new therapeutic strategies that can interfere with tumour outgrowth
	without affecting wound healing processes. These new therapeutic
	approaches may be of importance especially after surgery or other
	invasive (diagnostic) procedures in cancer patients.},

	Animal research facility of Roger Williams Medical Center, Providence,
	RI. STUDY GROUP: Seventeen groups of 5 C57BL/6 mice each. INTERVENTIONS:
	A surgical wound was created in 1 hind limb, after which different
	concentrations of B16F10 melanoma cells were injected in adjacent
	subcutaneous tissue. The nonwounded hind limb in the same mouse served
	as a control. In this fashion, a critical tumor cell dose was determined
	that showed tumor growth in the wounded but not the control hind
	limb. Tumor growth in control hind limbs then was compared with that
	in the "artificially wounded" hind limbs, which were co-injected
	with mouse wound fluid or growth factors. Early (day 1) and late
	(day 10) wound fluids and tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta), basic
	fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), both combined, and interleukin 6
	(IL-6) were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Wound factors increase tumor
	growth, indicating potentiation of tumor recurrence at a surgical
	wound. RESULTS: The critical tumor cell dose was 10(3) cells. All
	growth factors and both wound fluids showed increased tumor growth
	over time except IL-6. Hind limbs injected with early wound fluid
	showed increased tumor growth over time when compared with those
	injected with late wound fluid (P<.001), TGF-beta (P<.001), bFGF
	(P<.001), and IL-6 (P<.001). Combined TGF-beta and bFGF co-injection
	resulted in increased tumor growth compared with TGF-beta (P<.001)
	and bFGF (P<.001), but did not differ significantly from early wound
	fluid (P<.07). CONCLUSIONS: The healing wound and its mediators in
	wound fluid or purified growth factors significantly enhanced tumor
	growth. Combining TGF-beta and bFGF increased tumor growth to a level
	closer to wound fluid. The inflammatory response provoked by wound
	healing mediators may be an important mechanism in tumor growth after
	ablative surgery.},

	term "odds ratio." The key odds ratio in each article was identified,
	and, when possible, an estimated risk ratio was calculated. The odds

	and graphically. RESULTS: Of 151 studies using odds ratios, 107 were
	suitable to estimate a risk ratio. The difference between the odds
	ratio and the estimated risk ratio was greater than 20\% in 47 (44\%)
	of these articles. An odds ratio appears to magnify an effect compared

	by using direct adjustment by period of diagnosis or death. Similarly,
	the effect of age often is presented graphically as age-specific
	rates for a given period of diagnosis. These approaches may be necessary
	if there is an absence of long-term data, as they provide a natural
	way for annually updating information when monitoring trends, or
	they may be a convenient way of summarizing a large amount of data
	(7, 10, 11, 39, 45). However, these summaries only can adjust for
	the effect of age in a given period; they implicitly ignore the cohort
	effect. The effect of cohort is an important factor in understanding
	time trends for many diseases. Thus, it is not advisable to use data
	analytic strategies that routinely ignore it. Another alternative
	to modeling is to give a graphical presentation of the age-specific
	rates themselves. As I noted in the introduction, some of the first
	analyses to identify the effect of cohort on diseases, such as tuberculosis
	and lung cancer, relied entirely on a graphical analysis. Although
	graphs certainly are an important part of the interpretation of time
	trends, it would be a mistake to limit your analysis to impressions
	of points on a graph. For example, such a perusal would not give
	an objective indication of the statistical significance of a particular
	pattern. Regression analysis forces us to recognize a fundamental
	problem with interpreting time trends in disease rates--a problem
	that you should remember, even when trying to understand a graphical
	display of time trends in age-specific rates.The article is concerned
	with the effects of age, period, and cohort on disease incidence
	and with mortality from that disease. The emphasis is on the interpretation
	of results from fitting regression models to data that include age,
	birth cohort, and period or year of diagnosis. Some examples are
	presented using U.S. data for lung cancer.},

	The predictive performance is investigated in an example and in a

	regression model we use the two-step bootstrap MA, which consists
	of a screening step to eliminate covariates thought to have no influence
	on the response, and a model-averaging step. We also apply the full
	model, variable selection using backward elimination based on Akaike's
	Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC)
	and the bagging approach. The predictive performance is measured
	by the mean squared error (MSE) and the coverage of confidence intervals
	for the true response. RESULTS: We obtained similar results for all
	approaches in the example. In the simulation the MSE was reduced
	by all approaches in comparison to the full model. The smallest values
	are obtained for bootstrap MA. Only the bootstrap MA and the full
	model correctly estimated the nominal coverage. The backward elimination
	procedures led to substantial underestimation and bagging to an overestimation
	of the true coverage. The screening step of bootstrap MA eliminates
	most of the unimportant factors. CONCLUSION: The new bootstrap MA
	approach shows promising results for predictive performance. It increases
	practical usefulness by eliminating unimportant factors in the screening
	step.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND Countries with a similar expenditure on healthcare within
	Europe exhibit differences in lung cancer survival. Survival in lung
	cancer was studied in 2001-2004 in England, Norway and Sweden. METHODS
	Nationwide cancer registries in England, Norway and Sweden were used
	to identify 250 828 patients with lung cancer from England, 18 386
	from Norway and 24 886 from Sweden diagnosed between 1996 and 2004,
	after exclusion of patients registered through death certificate
	only or with missing, zero or negative survival times. 5-Year relative
	survival was calculated by application of the period approach. The
	excess mortality between the countries was compared using a Poisson
	regression model. RESULTS In all subcategories of age, sex and follow-up
	period, the 5-year survival was lower in England than in Norway and
	Sweden. The age-standardised survival estimates were 6.5\%, 9.3\%
	and 11.3\% for men and 8.4\%, 13.5\% and 15.9\% for women in the
	respective countries in 2001-2004. The difference in excess risk
	of dying between the countries was predominantly confined to the
	first year of follow-up. The relative excess risk ratio during the
	first 3 months of follow-up comparing England with Norway 2001-2004
	varied between 1.23 and 1.46, depending on sex and age, and between
	1.56 and 1.91 comparing England with Sweden. CONCLUSION Access to
	healthcare and population awareness are likely to be major reasons
	for the differences, but it cannot be excluded that diagnostic and
	therapeutic activity play a role. Future improvements in lung cancer
	management may be seen early in follow-up.},

  abstract    = {To isolate progress against cancer from changes in competing causes
	of death, population cancer registries have traditionally reported
	cancer prognosis (net measures). But clinicians and cancer patients
	generally want to understand actual prognosis (crude measures): the
	chance of surviving, dying from the specific cancer and from competing
	causes of death in a given time period.To compare cancer and actual
	prognosis in the United States for four leading cancers-lung, breast,
	prostate, and colon-by age, comorbidity, and cancer stage and to
	provide templates to help patients, clinicians, and researchers understand
	actual prognosis.Using population-based registry data from the Surveillance,
	Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we calculated cancer
	prognosis (relative survival) and actual prognosis (five-year overall
	survival and the "crude" probability of dying from cancer and competing
	causes) for three important prognostic determinants (age, comorbidity
	[Charlson-score from 2012 SEER-Medicare linkage dataset] and cancer
	stage at diagnosis).For younger, healthier, and earlier stage cancer
	patients, cancer and actual prognosis estimates were quite similar.
	For older and sicker patients, these prognosis estimates differed
	substantially. For example, the five-year overall survival for an
	85-year-old patient with colorectal cancer is 54\% (cancer prognosis)
	versus 22\% (actual prognosis)-the difference reflecting the patient's
	substantial chance of dying from competing causes. The corresponding
	five-year chances of dying from the patient's cancer are 46\% versus
	37\%. Although age and comorbidity lowered actual prognosis, stage
	at diagnosis was the most powerful factor: The five-year chance of
	colon cancer death was 10\% for localized stage and 83\% for distant
	stage.Both cancer and actual prognosis measures are important. Cancer
	registries should routinely report both cancer and actual prognosis
	to help clinicians and researchers understand the difference between
	these measures and what question they can and cannot answer. We encourage
	them to use formats like the ones presented in this paper to communicate
	them clearly.},

  abstract    = {Accurate estimates of cancer survival are important for assessing
	optimal patient care and prognosis. Evaluation of these estimates
	via relative survival (a ratio of observed and expected survival
	rates) requires a population life table that is matched to the cancer
	population by age, sex, race and/or ethnicity, socioeconomic status,
	and ideally risk factors for the cancer under examination. Because
	life tables for all subgroups in a study may be unavailable, we investigated
	whether cause-specific survival could be used as an alternative for
	relative survival.We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
	and End Results Program for 2,330,905 cancer patients from January
	1, 1992, through December 31, 2004. We defined cancer-specific deaths
	according to the following variables: cause of death, only one tumor
	or the first of multiple tumors, site of the original cancer diagnosis,
	and comorbidities. Estimates of relative survival and cause-specific
	survival that were derived by use of an actuarial method were compared.Among
	breast cancer patients who were white, black, or of Asian or Pacific
	Islander descent and who were older than 65 years, estimates of 5-year
	relative survival (107.5\%, 106.6\%, and 103.0\%, respectively) were
	higher than estimates of 5-year cause-specific survival (98.6\%,
	95\% confidence interval [CI] = 98.4\% to 98.8\%; 97.4\%, 95\% CI
	= 96.2\% to 98.2\%; and 99.2\%, 95\% CI = 98.4\%, 99.6\%, respectively).
	Relative survival methods likely underestimated rates for cancers
	of the oral cavity and pharynx (eg, for white cancer patients aged
	{\AA}¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂ¥65 years, relative survival = 54.2\%, 95\% CI = 53.1\% to 55.3\%,
	and cause-specific survival = 60.1\%, 95\% CI = 59.1\% to 60.9\%)
	and the lung and bronchus (eg, for black cancer patients aged {\AA}¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ°ÃÂÃÂ¥65
	years, relative survival = 10.5\%, 95\% CI = 9.9\% to 11.2\%, and
	cause-specific survival = 11.9\%, 95\% CI = 11.2 \% to 12.6\%), largely
	because of mismatches between the population with these diseases
	and the population used to derive the life table. Socioeconomic differences
	between groups with low and high status in relative survival estimates
	appeared to be inflated (eg, corpus and uterus socioeconomic status
	gradient was 13.3\% by relative survival methods and 8.8\% by cause-specific
	survival methods).Although accuracy of the cause of death on a death
	certificate can be problematic for cause-specific survival estimates,
	cause-specific survival methods may be an alternative to relative
	survival methods when suitable life tables are not available.},

	general practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean daily rate of emergency
	general practitioner consultations, mean number of half days to the
	sixth bookable routine appointment, and attendance rates at out of
	hours services, minor injuries units, and accident and emergency
	departments. RESULTS: The change between the before and after study
	periods was not significantly different in the two towns for daily
	rate of emergency general practice consultations (mean difference
	-0.02/1000 population, 95\% confidence interval -0.75 to 0.71), the
	time to the sixth bookable routine appointment (-0.24 half-days,
	-1.85 to 1.37), and daily rate of attendances at out of hours services
	(0.07/1000 population, -0.06 to 0.19). However, attendance at the
	local minor injuries unit was significantly higher in Loughborough
	than Market Harborough (rate ratio 1.22, 1.12 to 1.33). Non-ambulance
	attendances at accident and emergency departments fell less in Loughborough
	than Market Harborough (rate ratio 1.17, 1.03 to 1.33). CONCLUSIONS:
	The NHS walk-in centre did not greatly affect the workload of local
	general practitioners. However, the workload of the local minor injuries
	unit increased significantly, probably because it was in the same
	building as the walk-in centre.},

	population. In many follow-up studies with heavy censoring, the expected
	QAS may not be well estimated due to the lack of data beyond the
	close of follow-up. In this paper, we first created a reference population
	from the life tables of the general population according to the Monte
	Carlo method. Secondly, we fitted a simple linear regression line
	to the logit of the ratio of quality-adjusted survival functions
	for the index and reference populations up to the end of follow-up.
	Finally, combining information on the reference population with the
	fitted line, we predicted the expected quality-adjusted survival
	curve beyond the follow-up period for the index population. Simulation
	studies have shown that the simple Monte Carlo estimation procedure
	is a potential approach for estimating expected QAS and the survival
	function beyond the follow-up with a certain degree of accuracy.},

  abstract    = {In multi-state models, it has been the tradition to model all transition
	intensities on one time scale, usually the time since entry into
	the study ('clock-forward' approach). The effect of time since an
	intermediate event has been accommodated either by changing the time
	scale to time since entry to the new state ('clock-back' approach)
	or by including the time at entry to the new state as a covariate.
	In this paper, we argue that the choice of time scale for the various
	transitions in a multi-state model should be dealt with as an empirical
	question, as also the question of whether a single time scale is
	sufficient. We illustrate that these questions are best addressed
	by using parametric models for the transition rates, as opposed to
	the traditional Cox-model-based approaches. Specific advantages are
	that dependence of failure rates on multiple time scales can be made
	explicit and described in informative graphical displays. Using a
	single common time scale for all transitions greatly facilitates
	computations of probabilities of being in a particular state at a
	given time, because the machinery from the theory of Markov chains
	can be applied. However, a realistic model for transition rates is
	preferable, especially when the focus is not on prediction of final
	outcomes from start but on the analysis of instantaneous risk or
	on dynamic prediction. We illustrate the various approaches using
	a data set from stem cell transplant in leukemia and provide supplementary
	online material in R.},

	1975. Design: Population-based study of data extracted from the Osaka
	Cancer Registry. Setting: Population-based cancer registry in the
	area of Osaka Prefecture. Participants: All 66,032 cases diagnosed
	with a stomach cancer in Osaka Prefecture, Japan between 1975 and
	2000 and registered in the Osaka Cancer Registry. Main outcome measures:
	'Cure' fraction and median survival time for 'uncured' patients were
	estimated with multivariable mixture 'cure' model. The role played
	by age and stage at diagnosis on the changes in 'cure' parameters
	between 1975 and 2000 was evaluated. Missing stage was handled by
	multiple imputation approach. Results: More than 50\% of the patients
	diagnosed with a stomach cancer in 1996-2000 were estimated 'cured'
	from their cancer, corresponding to a 20\% increase since 1975-1980.
	Median survival time for 'uncured' patients however remained unchanged
	at about 8 months. 'Cure' fraction was over 85\% for localised tumours
	and 30\% for regional tumours, but stayed as low as 2.5\% for distant
	metastatic cancers. Improvement was underestimated by about 10\%
	because of ageing of cancer patients. Changes in stage distribution
	explained up to 40\% of the increase in 'cure' fraction among men
	and up to 13\% in women. Overdiagnosis was unlikely to play any role
	in these patterns. Conclusions: 'Cure' fraction from stomach cancer
	dramatically increased in Osaka, Japan since 1975, partly because
	of earlier stage at diagnosis, but mostly due to improvement in treatment
	of stomach cancer patients. This study, based on a leading country
	in term of stomach cancer management, provides insightful results
	for other countries in which 'cure' fraction is usually much lower.},

	briefly four classes of cooked food toxicants, e.g. acrylamide, heterocyclic
	amines, nitrosamines and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Many of these
	compounds have been recognised for decades also as environmental
	pollutants. In addition cigarette smokers and some occupational workers
	are exposed to them. Their occurrence, formation, metabolic activation,
	genotoxicity and human cancer risk are briefly presented along with
	figures on estimated exposure. Several lines of evidence indicate
	that cooking conditions and dietary habits can contribute to human
	cancer risk through the ingestion of genotoxic compounds from heat-processed
	foods. Such compounds cause different types of DNA damage: nucleotide
	alterations and gross chromosomal aberrations. Most genotoxic compounds
	begin their action at the DNA level by forming carcinogen-DNA adducts,
	which result from the covalent binding of a carcinogen or part of
	a carcinogen to a nucleotide. The genotoxic and carcinogenic potential
	of these cooked food toxicants have been evaluated regularly by the
	International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which has come
	to the conclusion that several of these food-borne toxicants present
	in cooked foods are possibly (2A) or probably (2B) carcinogenic to
	humans, based on both high-dose, long-term animal studies and in
	vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests. Yet, there is insufficient
	scientific evidence that these genotoxic compounds really cause human
	cancer, and no limits have been set for their presence in cooked
	foods. However, the competent authorities in most Western countries
	recommend minimising their occurrence, therefore this aspect is also

	of Cancer, Causes of Death and Total Population. 260,052 men were
	followed from 1971 through 2000. Industrial hygienists assessed specific
	exposures for 200 job titles, and occupational airborne exposures
	were analyzed separately and combined. Incidence rate ratios (IRR),
	with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), were estimated in multivariable
	Cox regression models adjusted for attained age, calendar period,
	smoking status and body mass. RESULTS: We found positive associations
	between high exposure to asbestos (IRR 4.5 [95\% CI 1.4-14.3]) and
	cement dust (IRR 3.8 [95\% CI 1.5-9.6]) and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
	Associations were seen between high exposure to asphalt fumes (IRR
	2.3 [95\% CI 1.0-5.3]) and wood dust (IRR 4.8 [95\% CI 1.2-19.4])
	and risk of cardia adenocarcinoma. No consistent associations regarding
	esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma were found. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure
	to asbestos and cement dust may be risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma,
	and exposure to asphalt fumes and wood dust may increase the risk
	of cardia adenocarcinoma. However, these associations cannot explain
	the major sex differences or the increasing incidence trends of these
	tumors.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: For reasons yet unknown, the incidence of esophageal and
	gastric cardia adenocarcinoma is increasing rapidly and moderately,
	respectively. These tumors occur predominantly among males. We hypothesized
	that stressful psychosocial working conditions might be involved
	in the etiology of these cancers. OBJECTIVE: To study if job strain,
	work pace satisfaction and coping are linked to the risk of esophageal
	or cardia cancers. METHODS: A nationwide Swedish population-based
	case-control study including 189 and 262 esophageal and cardia adenocarcinoma
	cases, respectively, 167 esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma cases,
	and 820 controls. All study subjects were interviewed. The relative
	risk was estimated using odds ratios, with 95\% confidence intervals,
	adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: We found no statistically
	significant associations between two different measures of job strain
	and the three cancer types, except between one job strain measure
	and risk of cardia adenocarcinoma (OR: 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.0-4.8). There
	was a moderately strong association between having a covert coping
	style, compared to an overt, and risk of both esophageal (OR: 1.8;
	95\% CI: 1.2-2.8) and cardia adenocarcinoma (OR: 1.5; 95\% CI: 1.0-2.3).
	Among subjects reporting low work pace satisfaction we found an almost
	4-fold increased risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (OR:
	3.8; 95\% CI: 1.3-11.0), and a nearly 3-fold increased risk of esophageal
	adenocarcinoma (OR: 2.8; 95\% CI: 1.1-7.0). CONCLUSIONS: Work-related
	stress does not seem to be of importance in the etiology of adenocarcinoma
	of the esophagus or the gastric cardia. However, the interaction
	of a stressful work environment and the individual's responses to
	it may be associated with a moderately increased risk of these cancer
	types.},

	12.7 million cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths are estimated

	site in males, comprising 17\% of the total new cancer cases and
	23\% of the total cancer deaths. Breast cancer is now also the leading
	cause of cancer death among females in economically developing countries,
	a shift from the previous decade during which the most common cause
	of cancer death was cervical cancer. Further, the mortality burden
	for lung cancer among females in developing countries is as high
	as the burden for cervical cancer, with each accounting for 11\%

  month = {Mar},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Maternal smoking has repeatedly been associated with
	increased infant mortality rates. No study has investigated whether
	smoking cessation influences the risk of infant death. This study
	estimates infant mortality after the second pregnancy in relation
	to smoking behavior in both the first and the second pregnancy. METHODS::
	We used the Swedish Medical Birth Register to identify women who
	delivered their first and second singleton infants during 1983-2002.
	Maternal smoking during the 2 pregnancies was categorized into (1)
	never smoker, (2) quitter, (3) starter, and (4) persistent smoker.
	In the second pregnancy, 555,046 live births (of at least 22 completed
	gestational weeks) were followed for infant death within 1 year.
	Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\%
	confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS:: Compared with infants born
	to never smokers, the HR (95\% CI) of infant mortality in the second
	pregnancy was 2.0 (1.7-2.4) among infants born to persistently heavy
	smokers, whereas among women who stopped smoking in the second pregnancy,
	the HRs were 1.4 (1.0-2.0) among those who had been heavy smokers
	in the first pregnancy, and 1.0 (0.8-1.2) among those who had been
	light smokers. The association of smoking during pregnancy with infant
	mortality was modified by infant's age, and was strongest at 4-15
	weeks after birth. The smoking effect on neonatal mortality, but
	not postneonatal mortality, was mediated by gestational age. CONCLUSIONS::
	Smoking cessation reduced the risk of infant death. The smoking-related
	risk of neonatal mortality appears to be mediated by smoking effects
	on gestational age, a factor that only partly explains the association

	history of breast cancer. We followed a cohort of women aged 15-44ÃÂÃÂ years

	Family history was defined as having a mother or sister with breast
	cancer. We estimated incidence rate ratios of breast cancer during

	focus on pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC), defined as breast
	cancer during pregnancy or within 2ÃÂÃÂ years post-delivery. In 3,452,506
	women, there were 15,548 cases of breast cancer (1208 were PABC).
	Compared to nulliparous women, the risk of breast cancer was decreased
	during pregnancy, similar during first year and increased during
	second year post-delivery. The pattern was similar in women with
	or without family history of breast cancer. A peak in risk was observed
	5-6ÃÂÃÂ years following the first birth regardless of family history.
	After a second birth, this peak was only present in women with a

	This study investigated the mortality in women with PABC in relation
	to when the tumor was detected (during pregnancy, different postpartum
	periods) and by time since diagnosis, compared with women with non-PABC.A
	population-based cohort study of 15,721 Swedish women diagnosed with
	breast cancer between ages 15 to 44 years, of whom 1,110 (7\%) had
	a PABC (diagnosed during or within two years after pregnancy). Information
	on outcome and potential confounders was obtained from population-based
	health registers. Mortality rates and HRs with 95\% CIs were estimated.Women
	with PABC had higher mortality compared with women with non-PABC
	diagnosed at the same age and calendar period. Among women with PABC,
	46\% died within 15 years after diagnosis, whereas 34\% died among
	non-PABC patients. The mortality in both groups peaked at around
	two years after diagnosis, with the highest peak occurring in women
	diagnosed 4 to 6 months after delivery (HR = 3.8, 95\% CI: 2.4-5.9).
	An increased mortality among women with PABC remained until 10 years
	after diagnosis.Women with PABC had a poorer prognosis compared with
	women with breast cancer and no recent birth. The mortality increase
	was most pronounced in the subgroup of women diagnosed shortly after
	delivery.An increased awareness among clinicians may help reduce
	the mortality in women with PABC, for example, by avoiding undue
	delays in diagnosis and treatment.},

	without initial therapy determines the potential for survival benefit
	following radical local treatment. However, little is known about
	disease progression and mortality beyond 10 to 15 years of watchful
	waiting. OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term natural history of untreated,
	early stage prostatic cancer. DESIGN: Population-based, cohort study
	with a mean observation period of 21 years. SETTING: Regionally well-defined
	catchment area in central {S}weden (recruitment March 1977 through
	February 1984). PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 223 patients (98\%
	of all eligible) with early-stage (T0-T2 NX M0 classification), initially
	untreated prostatic cancer. Patients with tumor progression were
	hormonally treated (either by orchiectomy or estrogens) if they had
	symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression-free, cause-specific,
	and overall survival. RESULTS: After complete follow-up, 39 (17\%)
	of all patients experienced generalized disease. Most cancers had
	an indolent course during the first 10 to 15 years. However, further
	follow-up from 15 (when 49 patients were still alive) to 20 years
	revealed a substantial decrease in cumulative progression-free survival
	(from 45.0\% to 36.0\%), survival without metastases (from 76.9\%
	to 51.2\%), and prostate cancer-specific survival (from 78.7\% to
	54.4\%). The prostate cancer mortality rate increased from 15 per
	1000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 10-21) during the first
	15 years to 44 per 1000 person-years (95\% confidence interval, 22-88)
	beyond 15 years of follow-up (P =.01). CONCLUSION: Although most
	prostate cancers diagnosed at an early stage have an indolent course,
	local tumor progression and aggressive metastatic disease may develop
	in the long term. These findings would support early radical treatment,
	notably among patients with an estimated life expectancy exceeding
	15 years.},

	incident records with deceased patients linked to both state death
	records and the NDI. Survival estimates and 95\% confidence intervals

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Docetaxel administered every 3 weeks is a standard treatment
	for castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer. We hypothesised
	that 2-weekly administration of docetaxel would be better tolerated
	than 3-weekly docetaxel in patients with castration-resistant advanced
	prostate cancer, and did a prospective, multicentre, randomised,
	phase 3 study to compare efficacy and safety. METHODS: Eligible patients
	had advanced prostate cancer (metastasis, a prostate-specific-antigen
	test result of more than 10{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·0 ng/mL, and WHO performance status
	score of 0-2), had received no chemotherapy (except with estramustine),
	had undergone surgical or chemical castration, and had been referred
	to a treatment centre in Finland, Ireland, or Sweden. Enrolment and
	treatment were done between March 1, 2004, and May 31, 2009. Randomisation
	was done centrally and stratified by centre and WHO performance status
	score of 0-1 vs 2. Patients were assigned 75 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously
	on day 1 of a 3-week cycle, or 50 mg/m(2) docetaxel intravenously
	on days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle. 10 mg oral prednisolone was administered
	daily to all patients. The primary endpoint was time to treatment
	failure (TTTF). We assessed data in the per-protocol population.
	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00255606.
	FINDINGS: 177 patients were randomly assigned to the 2-weekly docetaxel
	group and 184 to the 3-weekly group. 170 patients in the 2-weekly
	group and 176 in the 3-weekly group were included in the analysis.
	The 2-weekly administration was associated with significantly longer
	TTTF than was 3-weekly administration (5{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·6 months, 95\% CI 5{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·0-6{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·2
	vs 4{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·9 months, 4{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·5-5{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·4; hazard ratio 1{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·3, 95\% CI 1{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·1-1{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·6,
	p=0{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·014). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred more frequently in the
	3-weekly than in the 2-weekly administration group, including neutropenia
	(93 [53\%] vs 61 [36\%]), leucopenia (51 [29\%] vs 22 [13\%]), and
	febrile neutropenia (25 [14\%] vs six [4\%]). Neutropenic infections
	were reported more frequently in patients who received docetaxel
	every 3 weeks (43 [24\%] vs 11 [6\%], p=0{\AA}ÃÂÃÂ·002). INTERPRETATION:
	Administration of docetaxel every 2 weeks seems to be well tolerated
	in patients with castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer and
	could be a useful option when 3-weekly single-dose administration
	is unlikely to be tolerated. FUNDING: Sanofi.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the gold standard of 24-hour urine
	collection for measuring albumin excretion in pre-eclamptic women
	could be substituted by shorter collection periods. DESIGN: Prospective
	study. SETTING: Fetal maternity ward, university hospital. PARTICIPANTS:
	Thirty women with pre-eclampsia and a positive urinary test strip
	for protein of at least 2+. METHODS: From each woman, within a 25-hour
	period, three spot, two 12-hour (day and night) and one 24-hour urine
	sample were collected. Urine albumin concentrations in milligrammes
	per litre were analysed by rate nephelometry on a Beckman Array protein
	system. The urinary albumin concentrations in the spot and the 12-hour
	samples were compared with the concentration in the 24-hour urine
	collection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urinary albumin concentrations
	in spot and 12-hour samples measured against the standard 24-hour
	albumin excretion. RESULTS: Albumin concentrations in the day and
	night collection fitted closely with the concentrations of the 24-hour
	collection. The median difference between the 24-hour and the day
	collection was -3 mg/L (interquartile range -264 to 116 mg/L). The
	median difference between the 24-hour and the night collection was
	17 mg/L (interquartile range -186 to 210 mg/L). The association of
	urinary albumin concentration in the 24-hour collection and the spot
	samples was much weaker. Of the spot urine samples, the albumin concentration
	in the sample taken on the morning after admission to hospital was
	closest to the 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, with a median difference
	of -62 mg/L (interquartile range -1131 to 285 mg/L). CONCLUSION:
	The gold standard of 24-hour urinary excretion for assessment of
	albuminuria in pre-eclamptic women can be substituted with a 12-hour
	collection. Spot urine samples were inaccurate and are therefore
	not recommended for quantification of albumin excretion.},

  abstract = {Dog collars made of PVC plastic impregnated with the pyrethroid insecticide
	deltamethrin at 40 mg/g were investigated for their protective efficacy
	against phlebotomine sandflies. Collared dogs were kept separately
	(two untreated control dogs lived together) in outdoor enclosures,
	each with a kennel, in the C{\AA}¨ÃÂÃÂµÃÂÃÂ¥nnes, southern France. To measure
	sandfly mortality and anti-feeding effects due to the deltamethrin-impregnated
	collars worn continuously by the dogs for up to 8 months, each dog
	was periodically sedated and exposed for 2h to 150-200 laboratory-reared
	Phlebotomus perniciosus females (plus c. 25 males) inside a net (1.2
	m square, 1.8 m high) indoors. After dogs were removed from the nets,
	allowed to recover and returned to their kennels, any dead sandflies
	were collected from inside the net and counted. Surviving flies were
	kept overnight, then scored according to whether they were still
	alive or dead, unfed or blood-fed. From tests 2, 3, 4, 13, 20, 26
	and 34 weeks after the dogs began wearing collars, the overall numbers
	of blood-fed female sandflies recaptured were 75 from two dogs with
	collars, compared with 1911 from two collarless dogs. Thus, for every
	100 flies which fed on collarless dogs, only 4 fed on collared dogs,
	i.e. the collars protected dogs from 96\% of the bites and this activity
	was maintained for up to 34 weeks. During the same period, the percentage
	of recaptured female sandflies that had fed on collared dogs was
	0-12\% compared to 55-95\% on collarless dogs. Immediately after
	dogs were taken out of the nets, 21-60\% of flies confined with the
	collared dogs were found dead, compared to 0-12\% with the controls.
	It is concluded that, at least in the Mediterranean subregion, this
	insecticidal collar would protect a dog from the majority of sandfly
	bites and retain a killing effect for a complete sandfly season.
	Moreover, it seems likely that the use of collars on all dogs in
	a focus of Leishmania infantum would reduce contact between sandfly
	vectors and canine reservoir hosts sufficiently to diminish the risk
	of infection for humans as well as dogs.},

	method based on first (KM[1st]) or all (KM[any]) events, are applied
	to a database comprising 2521 women treated for breast carcinoma
	at the same institution and observed for more than 20 years. The
	authors relate these estimates to the region containing all possible
	estimates of failure rate. This region contains the "true" risk (net
	risk, or risk that would be observed in the absence of competing
	risks) of local or distant failure.The CI estimate is the lowest
	possible estimate of the true failure rate. Under certain "commonsense"
	assumptions, the CI estimate is below the lowest possible estimate
	of risk of failure. The KM(1st) estimate is higher than the CI estimate
	and lower than the KM(any) estimate. Under the same commonsense assumptions,
	the KM(1st) method also underestimates the true failure rate.Methods

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sociodemographic differentials in cancer survival
	have occasionally been studied by using a relative survival approach,
	where all cause mortality among persons with a cancer diagnosis is
	compared with that among similar persons without such a diagnosis
	("normal" mortality). One should ideally take into account that this
	"normal" mortality not only depends on age, sex, and period, but
	also various other sociodemographic variables. However, this has
	very rarely been done. A method that permits such variations to be
	considered is presented here, as an alternative to an existing technique,
	and is compared with a relative survival model where these variations
	are disregarded and two other methods that have often been used.
	DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The focus is on how education
	and marital status affect the survival from 12 common cancer types
	among men and women aged 40-80. Four different types of hazard models
	are estimated, and differences between effects are compared. The
	data are from registers and censuses and cover the entire Norwegian
	population for the years 1960-1991. There are more than 100 000 deaths
	to cancer patients in this material. MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
	A model for registered cancer mortality among cancer patients gives
	results that for most, but not all, sites are very similar to those
	from a relative survival approach where educational or marital variations
	in "normal" mortality are taken into account. A relative survival
	approach without consideration of these sociodemographic variations
	in "normal" mortality gives more different results, the most extreme
	example being the doubling of the marital differentials in survival
	from prostate cancer. When neither sufficient data on cause of death
	nor on variations in "normal" mortality are available, one may well
	choose the simplest method, which is to model all cause mortality
	among cancer patients. There is little reason to bother with the
	estimation of a relative-survival model that does not allow sociodemographic
	variations in "normal" mortality beyond those related to age, sex,
	and period. Fortunately, both these less data demanding models perform
	well for the most aggressive cancers.},

	of the general population by computing relative survival ratios.
	We also compared causes of death in these patients with those in
	16,151 matched controls.One-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year relative survival
	ratios were 0.98 (95\% CI 0.97-0.99), 0.93 (0.91-0.95), 0.82 (0.79-0.84),
	and 0.70 (0.64-0.76), respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of the
	gammopathy was associated with a significantly lower excess mortality
	compared to that in older patients (p<0.001). The excess mortality
	among patients with gammopathy increased with longer follow-up (p<0.0001).
	IgM (versus IgG/A) gammopathy was associated with a superior survival
	(p=0.038). Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
	had an increased risk of dying from multiple myeloma (hazards ratio
	(HR)=553; 95\% CI 77-3946), Waldenstr\"{o}m's macroglobulinemia (HR=infinity),

	in the elderly and explained by both malignant transformation and
	non-malignant causes, is of importance in the understanding and clinical
	management of this disease. The underlying mechanisms may be causally

	disease that led to the detection of the hematologic disease. Our
	results are of importance since they give a true estimation of survival

	renal failure in adults, and few data are available concerning the
	outcome of renal transplantation in these patients. We conducted
	this retrospective multicentric study to appreciate the outcome of
	adult renal transplant recipients whose primary disease was HUS.
	Sixteen patients, transplanted between 1975 and 1995, were included
	in the study. In each case, initial diagnosis of HUS was documented
	by a kidney biopsy. These 16 patients received a total of 25 allografts:
	1 graft for 9 patients, 2 grafts for 5 patients, and 3 grafts for
	2 patients. Nine patients (56\%) developed definite clinical and
	pathologic evidence of recurrence on at least 1 graft. Four additional
	patients (25\%) demonstrated only some clinical or pathologic evidence
	of recurrence which could not be distinguished from acute vascular
	rejection. Three patients had no sign of recurrence of the initial
	disease. The 1-year graft survival rate was 63\% and the 5-year graft
	survival rate was 18.5\%. In the group of patients with proven or
	possible recurrence (n = 13), the 1-year and 5-year graft survival
	rates were 49\% and less than 10\%, respectively. The recurrence
	was an early event, occurring before the end of the first month after
	transplantation in half the cases. The recurrence rate was 92\% in
	non-nephrectomized patients and 50\% in patients with bilateral nephrectomy.
	In the literature, 71 adult patients with primary HUS had received
	a total of 90 kidney grafts. Among them, 54\% had a recurrence on
	their graft, which was diagnosed in 52\% of the kidney transplants.
	It is note-worthy that when data from the literature are pooled with
	our results, the rate of recurrence appears to be significantly lower
	in binephrectomized patients than in patients with their native kidneys
	at the time of transplantation (5 of 14 versus 27 of 35 patients,
	respectively, p = 0.0155). By univariate analysis, no other risk
	factor for recurrence could be identified. Treatment with cyclosporine
	A did not influence the recurrence rate. We conclude that recurrence
	of HUS after renal transplantation is a frequent, early, and severe
	complication, leading rapidly to graft loss. Prospective studies

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. The effect of pregnancy on the risk of breast cancer is
	not clear. We tested the hypothesis that the risk of breast cancer
	increases transiently after pregnancy but then falls to a level below
	that of age-matched nulliparous women. METHODS. We conducted a case-control
	study of a nationwide cohort in Sweden, using a computerized record
	linkage between the Cancer Registry and the Fertility Registry. The
	study subjects were women born from 1925 through 1960 who were resident
	citizens of Sweden at the time of the 1960 census. A total of 12,666
	patients with breast cancer were compared with 62,121 age-matched
	control subjects. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate
	odds ratios for the development of breast cancer at different ages,
	according to maternal age at first delivery (in uniparous as compared
	with nulliparous women) and age at second delivery (in biparous as
	compared with uniparous women). RESULTS. Uniparous women were at
	higher risk of breast cancer than nulliparous women for up to 15
	years after childbirth and at lower risk thereafter. The excess risk
	was most pronounced among women who were older at the time of their
	first delivery (odds ratio 5 years after delivery among women 35
	years old at first delivery, 1.26; 95 percent confidence interval,
	1.10 to 1.44). Women who had two pregnancies had a less striking
	increase in risk. CONCLUSIONS. Pregnancy has a dual effect on the
	risk of breast cancer: it transiently increases the risk after childbirth
	but reduces the risk in later years. In women with two pregnancies,
	the short-term adverse effect is masked by the long-term protection
	imparted by the first pregnancy. A plausible biologic interpretation
	is that pregnancy increases the short-term risk of breast cancer
	by stimulating the growth of cells that have undergone the early
	stages of malignant transformation but that it confers long-term
	protection by inducing the differentiation of normal mammary stem
	cells that have the potential for neoplastic change.},

  abstract = {Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with significant
	maternal and foetal morbidity. Measurement of blood pressure remains
	the standard way of identifying individuals at risk. There is growing
	interest in the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitors (ABPM),
	which can record an individual's blood pressure many times over a
	24-hour period. From a clinical perspective interest lies in the
	shape of the blood pressure profile over a 24-hour period and any
	differences in the profile between groups. We propose a two-level
	hierarchical linear model incorporating all ABPM data into a single
	model. We contrast a classical approach with a Bayesian approach
	using the results of a study of 206 pregnant women who were asked
	to wear an ABPM for 24 hours after referral to an obstetric day unit
	with high blood pressure. As the main interest lies in the shape
	of the profile, we use restricted cubic splines to model the mean
	profiles. The use of restricted cubic splines provides a flexible
	way to model the mean profiles and to make comparisons between groups.
	From examining the data and the fit of the model it is apparent that
	there were heterogeneous within-subject variances in that some women
	tend to have more variable blood pressure than others. Within the
	Bayesian framework it is relatively easy to incorporate a random
	effect to model the between-subject variation in the within-subject
	variances. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in the within-subject
	variances, allowing for this in the model has surprisingly little
	impact on the estimates of the mean profiles or their confidence/credible
	intervals. We thus demonstrate a powerful method for analysis of
	ABPM data and also demonstrate how heterogeneous within-subject variances
	can be modelled from a Bayesian perspective.},

	are cost effective as well as clinically effective. It is becoming
	increasingly common for cost studies to be incorporated into clinical
	trials, either on all patients or more usually on a subset of patients.
	Establishing the total cost per patient is complex, as it requires
	information on resource use, which may come from a variety of different
	sources. This complexity may lead to considerable missing data, and
	can result in some patients only having partial cost information.
	In this paper we consider a clinical trial consisting of 351 patients
	with advanced non-small cell lung cancer comparing chemotherapy with
	standard palliative care. A subset of 115 patients was selected for
	the cost sub-study. Total cost was split into four components, for
	which resource use was collected. Complete resource data were available
	on 82 patients. For the remaining patients at least one of the cost
	components was missing. The objective of this paper is to develop
	a Bayesian approach which simultaneously models both the clinical
	effectiveness data and the cost data, by modelling the individual
	components. This also provides estimates of the cost-effectiveness
	in terms of the Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB) and Cost-Effectiveness
	Acceptability Curves (CEAC). We compare a number of different models
	of increasing complexity. The models estimate the interrelationships
	between the four cost components and survival, and thus enable a
	predictive distribution for each missing cost item to be obtained.},

  abstract = {Relative survival is used to estimate patient survival excluding causes
	of death not related to the disease of interest. Rather than using
	cause of death information from death certificates, which is often
	poorly recorded, relative survival compares the observed survival
	to that expected in a matched group from the general population.
	Models for relative survival can be expressed on the hazard (mortality)
	rate scale as the sum of two components where the total mortality
	rate is the sum of the underlying baseline mortality rate and the
	excess mortality rate due to the disease of interest. Previous models
	for relative survival have assumed that covariate effects act multiplicatively
	and have thus provided relative effects of differences between groups
	using excess mortality rate ratios. In this paper we consider (i)
	the use of an additive covariate model, which provides estimates
	of the absolute difference in the excess mortality rate; and (ii)
	the use of fractional polynomials in relative survival models for
	the baseline excess mortality rate and time-dependent effects. The
	approaches are illustrated using data on 115 331 female breast cancer
	patients diagnosed between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 1990. The
	use of additive covariate relative survival models can be useful
	in situations when the excess mortality rate is zero or slightly
	less than zero and can provide useful information from a public health
	perspective. The use of fractional polynomials has advantages over
	the usual piecewise estimation by providing smooth estimates of the
	baseline excess mortality rate and time-dependent effects for both
	the multiplicative and additive covariate models. All models presented
	in this paper can be estimated within a generalized linear models
	framework and thus can be implemented using standard software.},

  abstract    = {There has been a recent growth in the use of Bayesian methods in medical
	research. The main reasons for this are the development of computer
	intensive simulation based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC), increases in computing power and the introduction of powerful
	software such as WinBUGS. This has enabled increasingly complex models
	to be fitted. The ability to fit these complex models has led to
	MCMC methods being used as a convenient tool by frequentists, who
	may have no desire to be fully Bayesian.Often researchers want 'the
	data to dominate' when there is no prior information and thus attempt
	to use vague prior distributions. However, with small amounts of
	data the use of vague priors can be problematic. The results are
	potentially sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. In general
	there are fewer problems with location parameters. The main problem
	is with scale parameters. With scale parameters, not only does one
	have to decide the distributional form of the prior distribution,
	but also whether to put the prior distribution on the variance, standard
	deviation or precision.We have conducted a simulation study comparing
	the effects of 13 different prior distributions for the scale parameter
	on simulated random effects meta-analysis data. We varied the number
	of studies (5, 10 and 30) and compared three different between-study
	variances to give nine different simulation scenarios. One thousand
	data sets were generated for each scenario and each data set was
	analysed using the 13 different prior distributions. The frequentist
	properties of bias and coverage were investigated for the between-study
	variance and the effect size.The choice of prior distribution was
	crucial when there were just five studies. There was a large variation
	in the estimates of the between-study variance for the 13 different
	prior distributions. With a large number of studies the choice of
	prior distribution was less important. The effect size estimated
	was not biased, but the precision with which it was estimated varied
	with the choice of prior distribution leading to varying coverage
	intervals and, potentially, to different statistical inferences.
	Again there was less of a problem with a larger number of studies.
	There is a particular problem if the between-study variance is close
	to the boundary at zero, as MCMC results tend to produce upwardly
	biased estimates of the between-study variance, particularly if inferences
	are based on the posterior mean.The choice of 'vague' prior distribution
	can lead to a marked variation in results, particularly in small
	studies. Sensitivity to the choice of prior distribution should always
	be assessed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In general, elderly patients with Hodgkin's
	lymphoma (HL) have a less favorable prognosis than younger patients.
	Factors such as inadequate therapy often due to decreased tolerance
	to treatment, presence of intercurrent diseases and accumulation
	of certain clinical and biological risk factors contribute to the
	poor outcome. Established predictors of prognosis in HL are less
	appropriate in the elderly population. Consequently, there is a need
	for additional markers to guide treatment decisions and to improve
	prediction of outcome. In the general population, the expected length
	of life of an individual is intimately associated with that of his/her
	parents. In a small cohort of elderly HL patients, we had previously
	observed high familial life-span of two previous generations predicts
	superior survival. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis
	that parental longevity alone--an easily accessible and non-disease
	associated variable--is also associated with improved outcome using
	an enlarged series of elderly HL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: One
	hundred and twenty-one patients with HL >60 years at diagnosis were
	included. The median follow-up time was 67 (range 37-175) months.
	Data regarding age at death and reported cause of death were available
	through parish offices for 228 (94\%) parents. The effect of parental
	lifespan on HL survival included the use of Kaplan-Meier curves and
	Cox' proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS. Maternal
	as well as paternal lifespan correlated poorly with HL survival,
	both with regard to overall and disease-specific survival. There
	was, however, a tendency towards a decreased risk of dying among
	patients with low maternal lifespan (all-cause mortality: RR=0.7,
	95\% CI 0.5-1.0). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Parental longevity
	does not predict superior survival in elderly patients with HL.},

	and timeliness of data for the period 1953-2005, with special attention
	to the registration period 2001-2005. RESULTS: The CRN coding and
	classification system by and large follows international standards,
	with some further subdivisions of morphology groupings performed
	in-house. The overall completeness was estimated at 98.8\% for the
	registration period 2001-2005. There remains a variable degree of
	under-reporting particularly for haematological malignancies (C90-95)
	and tumours of the central nervous system (C70-72). For the same

	range: 60.0-99.8\%). The under-reporting in 2005 due to timely publication
	is estimated at 2.2\% overall, based on the number of cases received
	at the registry during the following year. CONCLUSION: This review
	suggests the routines in place at the CRN yields comparable data
	that can be considered reasonably accurate, close-to-complete and
	timely, thereby justifying our policy of the reporting of annual
	incidence one year after the year of diagnosis.},

  abstract    = {Treatment switching commonly occurs in clinical trials of novel interventions
	in the advanced or metastatic cancer setting. However, methods to
	adjust for switching have been used inconsistently and potentially
	inappropriately in health technology assessments (HTAs).We present
	recommendations on the use of methods to adjust survival estimates
	in the presence of treatment switching in the context of economic
	evaluations.We provide background on the treatment switching issue
	and summarize methods used to adjust for it in HTAs. We discuss the
	assumptions and limitations associated with adjustment methods and
	draw on results of a simulation study to make recommendations on
	their use.We demonstrate that methods used to adjust for treatment
	switching have important limitations and often produce bias in realistic
	scenarios. We present an analysis framework that aims to increase
	the probability that suitable adjustment methods can be identified
	on a case-by-case basis. We recommend that the characteristics of
	clinical trials, and the treatment switching mechanism observed within
	them, should be considered alongside the key assumptions of the adjustment
	methods. Key assumptions include the "no unmeasured confounders"
	assumption associated with the inverse probability of censoring weights
	(IPCW) method and the "common treatment effect" assumption associated
	with the rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM).The
	limitations associated with switching adjustment methods such as
	the RPSFTM and IPCW mean that they are appropriate in different scenarios.
	In some scenarios, both methods may be prone to bias; "2-stage" methods
	should be considered, and intention-to-treat analyses may sometimes
	produce the least bias. The data requirements of adjustment methods
	also have important implications for clinical trialists.},

	progression-free survival between treatments), the incremental cost
	and the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios, for
	docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine, when these drugs were used
	as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
	In the absence of comparative direct evidence of the relative efficacy
	of docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine in this setting, a model
	was designed to determine the effects of the 3 interventions on health
	outcome and cost. A Markov process model, based on 53 disease states,
	was thus constructed to evaluate the socioeconomics of the 3 treatment
	regimens. The model allows assessments from the start of second-line
	chemotherapy until death. Costs were evaluated from the combined
	view of the healthcare system and the patient. Direct nonmedical
	and indirect costs were excluded. Consumption per episode of care
	was estimated by retrospective analysis of 153 medical reports from
	5 different hospitals. Hospital costs were allocated values from
	the national accounting costs by diagnosis-related group (DRG). The
	content of the health states was based on the multiattribute health
	states classification system (MASH). Preference values were assigned
	by application of a standard reference lottery using 20 oncological
	nurses as proxies for the patients. The health-related quality-of-life
	score was used as a quality adjustment weighting factor to calculate
	quality-adjusted progression-free survival associated with the 3
	different regimens. Docetaxel reduces the time spent in progression,

	on progression free survival; (3) the cost including the intrinsic
	cost of chemotherapy as well as the cost of treatment-related and
	disease-related complications, due to toxicity. Savings obtained
	with the treatment by delaying relapse were subtracted from expenditure.
	We used a Markov model to describe the patient's evolution after

	years or more attending breast units in Greater Manchester completed
	a survey measuring functional status (Elderly Population Health Status
	Survey's Activity of Daily Living), generic health status (Short
	Form 12) and health-related quality of life (European Organization
	for Research on Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
	C30). Case-note review assessed co-morbidity (Charlson Index) and
	management. Primary surgery for operable breast cancer was investigated
	using logistic regression. RESULTS: A Charlson Index of 1 or more
	did not predict the use of surgery (P = 0.363). However, for each
	point increase on the 1-4 scale indicating worsening functional status,
	the odds of having surgery decreased by 16 times (odds ratio 0.063).
	The odds of a woman of 80 years or more having surgery decreased
	by a factor of 44 (odds ratio 0.023) compared with women aged 65-79
	years, accounting for co-morbidity, functional status, pretreatment
	stage, social deprivation and type of hospital. CONCLUSION: Older
	women were less likely to have surgery for operable breast cancer

  abstract = {When multicentre clinical trial data are analysed, it has become more
	and more popular to look for possible heterogeneity in outcome between
	centres. However, beyond the investigation of such heterogeneity,
	it is also interesting to consider heterogeneity in treatment effect
	over centres. For time-to-event outcomes, this may be investigated
	by including a random centre effect and a random treatment by centre
	interaction in a Cox proportional hazards model.Assuming independence
	between the random effects, we propose a Bayesian approach to fit
	our proposed model. The parameters of interest are the variance components
	sigma(0) (2) and sigma(1) (2) of these random effects, which can
	be interpreted as a measure of centre and treatment effect over centres
	heterogeneity of the hazard. These variance components are estimated
	from their marginal posterior density after integrating out the fixed
	treatment effect and the random effects. As this integration cannot
	be performed analytically, the marginal posterior density is approximated
	using the Laplace integration technique. Statistical inference is
	then based on the characteristics of the posterior marginal density,
	such as the mode and the standard deviation. We demonstrate the proposed
	technique using data from a pooled database of seven EORTC bladder
	cancer clinical trials. Substantial centre and treatment effect over
	centres heterogeneity in disease-free interval was found.},

	the scarcity and heterogeneity of NET.A retrospective multicentric
	study was carried out, including all cases of OLT for NET performed

	carcinoid tumor and 16 cases of islet cell carcinomas. Hormone-related
	symptoms were present in 16 cases (55\%). Only 5 patients (16\%)
	had no previous surgical or medical therapy before OLT. Median delay
	from diagnosis of liver metastasis and OLT was 19 months (range,
	2 to 120).The primary tumor was removed at the time of OLT in 11
	cases, by upper abdominal exenteration in 7 cases and the Whipple
	resection in 3. Actuarial survival rate after OLT was 59\% at 1 year,
	47\% at 3 years, and 36\% at 5 years. Survival rates were significantly
	higher for metastatic carcinoid tumors (69\% at 5 years) than for
	noncarcinoid apudomas (8\% at 4 years), because of higher tumor-
	and non-tumor-related mortality rates for the latter.OLT can achieve

  number = {11},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Research has suggested that use of combined estrogen and
	progestin hormone replacement therapy (CHRT) increases breast cancer
	risk and that CHRT use is more strongly associated with the risk
	of invasive lobular breast carcinoma than that of invasive ductal
	carcinoma. Lobular carcinoma is less common than ductal carcinoma
	but can be more difficult to diagnose because of its subtle elusive
	infiltrative pattern. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in invasive lobular
	and ductal carcinoma incidence rates from 1987 through 1999, during
	which time use of CHRT increased in the United States. DESIGN: Descriptive
	epidemiologic study. SETTING: Nine cancer registries that participate
	in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program
	of the National Cancer Institute and that cover Atlanta, Ga; Detroit,
	Mich; San Francisco-Oakland, Calif; Seattle, Wash; and Connecticut,
	Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, and Utah. POPULATION: Women 30 years of
	age and older residing in the areas covered by the 9 SEER registries.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportional changes in incidence rates of
	invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma among women with no prior history
	of breast cancer. RESULTS: A total of 190 458 women were included
	in this analysis who were identified through the registries as having
	invasive breast cancer; 7682 of the 198 140 potentially eligible
	women (ie, those identified as not having in situ breast cancer)
	were excluded from this analysis because stage of cancer was unknown.
	Invasive breast cancer incidence rates adjusted for age and for SEER
	historic stage increased 1.04-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI],
	1.004-1.07) from 1987-1999 (206.7/100 000 to 214.1/100 000, age-adjusted).
	However, incidence rates of tumors classified as lobular increased
	1.52-fold (95\% CI, 1.42-1.63), and those classified as mixed ductal-lobular
	increased 1.96-fold (95\% CI, 1.80-2.14); rates of these types combined
	increased 1.65-fold (95\% CI, 1.55-1.78) (19.8/100 000 to 33.4/100
	000, age-adjusted). In contrast, ductal carcinoma rates remained
	largely constant (153.8/100 000 to 155.3/100 000, age-adjusted; proportional
	change, 1.03 [95\% CI, 0.99-1.06]). The proportion of breast cancers
	with a lobular component increased from 9.5\% in 1987 to 15.6\% in
	1999. CONCLUSIONS: Ductal carcinoma incidence rates remained essentially
	constant from 1987-1999 while lobular carcinoma rates increased steadily.
	This increase presents a clinical challenge given that lobular carcinoma
	is more difficult to detect than ductal carcinoma by both physical
	examination and mammography.},

	Data were generated from a 1:m matched design based on McNemar's
	2 x 2 tables with four scenarios for missing values: completely-at-random,

	In their analysis, the authors used conditional logistic regression
	for complete pairs and the missing-indicator method for all pairs.
	For 1:1 matched studies, given no confounding between exposure and
	disease, the two methods yielded unbiased estimates. Otherwise, conditional
	logistic regression produced unbiased estimates with empirical confidence
	interval coverage similar to nominal coverage under the first three
	missing-value scenarios, whereas the missing-indicator method produced
	slightly more bias and lower confidence interval coverage. An increased
	number of matched controls was associated with slightly more bias
	and lower confidence interval coverage. Under the case/exposure-dependent
	missing-value scenario, neither method performed satisfactorily;
	this indicates the need for more sophisticated statistical methods

	diseases in the presence of death for HIV-infected patients, and
	(3) the joint modeling of local, distant tumor recurrences and patients

	mmHg systolic and 86.0 mmHg diastolic, age averaged 66.5 years and
	total serum cholesterol was 5.1 mmol/l. After 2 years of follow-up,
	sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen by 10.9
	mmHg and 1.9 mmHg in the placebo group and by 20.0 mmHg and 5.0 mmHg
	in the active treatment group. The intergroup differences were 9.1
	mmHg systolic (95\% confidence interval 7.6-10.7 mmHg ) and 3.2 mmHg
	diastolic (95\% confidence interval 2.4-4.0). Active treatment reduced
	total strokes by 38\% (from 20.8 to 13.0 endpoints per 1000 patient-years,
	P=0.01), all-cause mortality by 39\% (from 28.4 to 17.4 endpoints
	per 1000 patient-years, P=0.003), cardiovascular mortality by 39\%
	(from 15.2 to 9.4 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.03), stroke
	mortality by 58\% (from 6.9 to 2.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years,
	P=0.02), and ail fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular endpoints by 37\%
	(from 33.3 to 21.4 endpoints per 1000 patient-years, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS:
	Antihypertensive treatment prevents stroke and other cardiovascular
	complications in older Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
	Treatment of 1000 Chinese patients for 5 years could prevent 55 deaths,
	39 strokes or 59 major cardiovascular endpoints.},

  abstract = {Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients with cancer. However,
	whether or not there is increased risk of mental disorders during
	the diagnostic workup leading to a cancer diagnosis was unknown.
	To examine the relative risks of depression, anxiety, substance abuse,
	somatoform/conversion disorder, and stress reaction/adjustment disorder
	during the periods before and after cancer diagnosis compared with
	individuals without cancer. Nationwide matched cohort study from
	January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010, in a Swedish population and
	health registers. We estimated the time-varying hazard ratios (HRs)
	of the first clinical diagnosis of the studied mental disorders from
	2 years before cancer diagnosis, through the time of diagnosis, and
	until 10 years after diagnosis, adjusting for age, sex, calendar
	period, and educational level. To assess milder mental conditions
	and symptoms, we further assessed the use of related psychiatric
	medications for patients with cancer diagnosed during 2008-2009.
	The study included 304{\AA}¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯118 patients with cancer and 3{\AA}¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯041{\AA}¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯174
	cancer-free individuals who were randomly selected from the Swedish
	population and individually matched to the patients with cancer on
	year of birth and sex. The median age at diagnosis for the patients
	with cancer was 69 years, and 46.9% of the patients were female.
	The relative rate for all studied mental disorders started to increase
	from 10 months before cancer diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2),
	peaked during the first week after diagnosis (HR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.1-7.4),
	and decreased rapidly thereafter but remained elevated 10 years after
	diagnosis (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2). The rate elevation was clear
	for all main cancers except nonmelanoma skin cancer and was stronger
	for cancers of poorer prognosis. Compared with cancer-free individuals,
	increased use of psychiatric medications was noted from 1 month before
	cancer diagnosis and peaked around 3 months after diagnosis among
	patients with cancer. Patients diagnosed as having cancer had increased
	risks of several common mental disorders from the year before diagnosis.
	These findings support the existing guidelines of integrating psychological
	management into cancer care and further call for extended vigilance
	for multiple mental disorders starting from the time of the cancer
	diagnostic workup.},

	Until January 2008, an estimated 75,638 individuals have changed

	of date of birth or sex among immigrants or newborns. Although uncommon,
	change of sex always leads to change of PIN since the PIN is sex-specific.
	The most common reasons for re-use of PIN (n = 15,887), is when immigrants
	are assigned a PIN that has previously been assigned to someone else.
	This is sometimes necessary since there is a shortage of certain
	PIN combinations referring to dates of birth in the 1950s and 1960s.
	Several ethical issues can be raised pro and con the use of PIN in
	medical research. The Swedish PIN is a useful tool for linkages between

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different scoring systems currently are being used to
	stratify patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) into
	risk groups. DTC is usually subdivided into papillary thyroid carcinoma
	(PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The objective of the
	current study was to identify those factors that predict long-term
	unfavorable prognosis and to evaluate the predictive accuracy of
	the TNM staging system. METHODS: The authors conducted a nested case-control
	study within the cohort of all patients (n=5123) diagnosed with DTC
	in {S}weden between 1958-1987 who survived at least 1 year after
	diagnosis. One control, matched by age at diagnosis, gender, and
	calendar period, was randomly selected for each case (patients who
	died of DTC). All patients were classified at the time of diagnosis
	according to the TNM staging system. The effect of prognostic factors
	on DTC mortality was evaluated using conditional logistic regression.
	RESULTS: Patients with widely invasive FTC experienced a significantly
	higher mortality compared with PTC patients. The grade of differentiation
	was found to influence mortality significantly. Patients with TNM
	Stage IV disease had a higher mortality rate compared with patients
	with Stage II disease (odds ratio [OR]=9.1; 95\% confidence interval
	[95\% CI], 5.7-14.6). Patients with lymph node metastases experienced
	a higher mortality (OR=2.5; 95\% CI, 1.6-4.1) and patients with distant
	metastasis at the time of diagnosis were found to have a nearly 7-fold
	higher mortality rate (OR=6.6; 95\% CI, 4.1-10.5). Incomplete surgical
	excision was associated with higher mortality, particularly in patients
	with Stage I disease. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the following
	were found to be clinically significant prognostic factors for patients
	with DTC: histopathologic subgroup, TNM staging including lymph node
	metastases and distant metastases, and completeness of the surgical
	excision.},

	histopathology reports. The relative survival ratio (RSR) was used
	as the measure of patient survival. Incidence of both PTC and FTC
	was higher among women, especially for PTC and particularly during
	the fertile part of female life. Incidence of PTC increased significantly
	over time, a trend that was not observed for FTC. Five-year relative
	survival appeared to be higher for patients diagnosed with PTC compared
	to FTC, although this difference was almost completely explained
	by the confounding effect of age. Patients with PTC experience lower
	mortality during the period 7-20 years after diagnosis. Excess mortality
	was lower among women, although the magnitude of the difference varied
	with age and histopathology. In contrast to our perceptions based
	on clinical practice, we observed no difference in excess mortality
	between patients diagnosed with PTC and FTC during the years immediately

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This paper provides a one-page visual summary of the previously
	published relative survival estimates for 42 types of cancers in
	23 countries in Europe. METHODS: The cancer patients in these analyses
	were 15 years or older at the time of their diagnosis in the period
	1995-1999. Follow-up was to the end of 2003 and relative survival
	estimates were computed by the cohort method. RESULTS: The analysis
	of 1-year survival had good discriminatory power and visibly separated
	a group of countries with consistently high survival estimates (Switzerland,
	France, Sweden, Belgium and Italy) and another group of countries
	with lower estimates (Poland, Czech Republic, Ireland, Denmark and
	United Kingdom-Northern Ireland). After the first year, there was
	less variation between the countries. CONCLUSION: To more fully understand
	the UK situation, a rational comparison would select countries with
	data-quality, prosperity and healthcare systems that are similar
	to the United Kingdom. In otherwise comparable populations, a pronounced
	difference in 1-year survival is most likely to be due to variation
	in a strong prognostic factor, which exerts its effect in the short
	term. A likely explanation for the short-term survival deficit in
	the United Kingdom compared with the Nordic countries is a less favourable
	stage distribution in the United Kingdom. However, the present superficial
	analysis does not exclude possible functions for other factors relating
	to the organisation and quality of cancer care services.},

  abstract = {Background:It has been suggested that cancer registries in England
	are too dependent on processing of information from death certificates,
	and consequently that cancer survival statistics reported for England
	are systematically biased and too low.Methods:We have linked routine
	cancer registration records for colorectal, lung, and breast cancer
	patients with information from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)
	database for the period 2001-2007. Based on record linkage with the
	HES database, records missing in the cancer register were identified,
	and dates of diagnosis were revised. The effects of those revisions
	on the estimated survival time and proportion of patients surviving
	for 1 year or more were studied. Cases that were absent in the cancer
	register and present in the HES data with a relevant diagnosis code
	and a relevant surgery code were used to estimate (a) the completeness
	of the cancer register. Differences in survival times calculated
	from the two data sources were used to estimate (b) the possible
	extent of error in the recorded survival time in the cancer register.
	Finally, we combined (a) and (b) to estimate (c) the resulting differences
	in 1-year cumulative survival estimates.Results:Completeness of case
	ascertainment in English cancer registries is high, around 98-99\%.
	Using HES data added 1.9\%, 0.4\% and 2.0\% to the number of colorectal,
	lung, and breast cancer registrations, respectively. Around 5-6\%
	of rapidly fatal cancer registrations had survival time extended
	by more than a month, and almost 3\% of rapidly fatal breast cancer
	records were extended by more than a year. The resulting impact on
	estimates of 1-year survival was small, amounting to 1.0, 0.8, and
	0.4 percentage points for colorectal, lung, and breast cancer, respectively.Interpretation:English
	cancer registration data cannot be dismissed as unfit for the purpose
	of cancer survival analysis. However, investigators should retain
	a critical attitude to data quality and sources of error in international
	cancer survival studies.British Journal of Cancer advance online

	from cancer registry records. Five-year cumulative relative survival
	and excess death rates were computed.For colon cancer there was a
	very high excess death rate in the first month of follow-up, and
	the excess death rate was highest in the socioeconomically deprived
	groups. In subsequent periods, excess mortality rates were much lower
	and there was less socioeconomic variation. The pattern of variation
	in excess death rates was generally similar in rectal cancer but
	the socioeconomic difference in death rates persisted several years
	longer. If the excess death rates in the entire colorectal cancer
	patient population were the same as those observed in the most affluent
	socioeconomic quintile, the annual reduction would be 360 deaths
	in colon cancer and 336 deaths in rectal cancer patients. These deaths
	occurred almost entirely in the first month and the first year after
	diagnosis.Recent developments in the national cancer control agenda
	have included an increasing emphasis on outcome measures, with short-term
	cancer survival an operational measure of variation and progress

	long-term use of oestrogen-progestin combinations on breast-cancer
	risk. We conducted a large epidemiological study in {S}weden, where
	combined oestrogen-progestin treatment has been predominant, to examine
	the influence of different regimens of menopausal hormone therapy
	on breast-cancer risk. In this population-based case-control study,
	3,345 women aged 50 to 74 years with invasive breast cancer (84\%

	used to collect detailed information on use of hormone replacement
	and on potential confounding factors. Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence
	intervals (CI) were estimated through multiple logistic regression.
	There was a trend of increasing breast-cancer risk with duration
	of oestrogen/oestrogen-progestin use (OR for women treated at least
	10 years, 2.43; 95\% CI, 1.79-3.30, as compared to never-users),

	which was noted for use of oestrogen combined with testosterone-derived

	Although designed to account for between-patient sampling variability

	to CEA ignore the presence of between-location variability in the
	study results. This is a restrictive limitation given that countries
	often differ in factors that could affect the results of CEAs, such
	as the availability of health care resources, their unit costs, clinical
	practice, and patient case mix. The authors advocate the use of Bayesian
	bivariate hierarchical modeling to analyze multinational cost-effectiveness
	data. This analytical framework explicitly recognizes that patient-level
	costs and outcomes are nested within countries. Using real-life data,
	the authors illustrate how the proposed methods can be applied to
	obtain (a) more appropriate estimates of overall cost-effectiveness
	and associated measure of sampling uncertainty compared to standard
	CEA and (b) country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates that can
	be used to assess the between-location variability of the study results
	while controlling for differences in country-specific and patient-specific
	characteristics. It is demonstrated that results from standard CEA
	using IPD from multinational trials display a large degree of variability
	across the 17 countries included in the analysis, producing potentially
	misleading results. In contrast, "shrinkage estimates'' obtained
	from the modeling approach proposed here facilitate the appropriate
	quantification of country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates while
	weighting the results based on the level of information available
	within each country. The authors suggest that the methods presented
	here represent a general framework for the analysis of economic data
	collected from different locations.},

	the final results with regard to estrogen plus progestin and CHD
	from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI).The WHI included a randomized
	primary-prevention trial of estrogen plus progestin in 16,608 postmenopausal
	women who were 50 to 79 years of age at base line. Participants were
	randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg
	per day) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg per day) or placebo.
	The primary efficacy outcome of the trial was CHD (nonfatal myocardial
	infarction or death due to CHD).After a mean follow-up of 5.2 years
	(planned duration, 8.5 years), the data and safety monitoring board
	recommended terminating the estrogen-plus-progestin trial because
	the overall risks exceeded the benefits. Combined hormone therapy
	was associated with a hazard ratio for CHD of 1.24 (nominal 95 percent
	confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.54; 95 percent confidence interval
	after adjustment for sequential monitoring, 0.97 to 1.60). The elevation
	in risk was most apparent at one year (hazard ratio, 1.81 [95 percent
	confidence interval, 1.09 to 3.01]). Although higher base-line levels
	of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with an excess
	risk of CHD among women who received hormone therapy, higher base-line
	levels of C-reactive protein, other biomarkers, and other clinical
	characteristics did not significantly modify the treatment-related
	risk of CHD.Estrogen plus progestin does not confer cardiac protection
	and may increase the risk of CHD among generally healthy postmenopausal
	women, especially during the first year after the initiation of hormone
	use. This treatment should not be prescribed for the prevention of

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide estimates and projections of cancer incidence
	and prevalence for those Italian regions whose population is partially
	covered by a cancer registry (CR) and to determine to what extent
	local CRs can be considered representative of the region, thus improving
	the potential of the information provided by CRs. METHODS: A statistical
	method, MIAMOD (mortality-incidence analysis model), was used to
	estimate regional cancer incidence and prevalence from regional cancer
	mortality data and patient survival data recorded by the cancer registries.
	Estimates of the cancer incidence and prevalence in the various regions
	have thus been obtained for a number of major cancer sitas. A first
	and important step in validating the regional estimates has been
	the comparison of the MIAMOD estimates in the areas covered by the
	cancer registries with empirical incidence and prevalence observed
	by CRs, in order to assess the consistency in data, methods and assumptions.
	Empirical prevalence has been calculated by counting patients with
	a diagnosis of cancer who were alive on the reference date by PREVAL
	method. A correction factor has been applied to include patients
	diagnosed before the period of activity of the registry. RESULTS:
	General consistency was found between empirical and estimated (by
	MIAMOD) incidence and prevalence in the registry areas, which is
	indicative of the quality and the completeness of all data involved
	as well as the appropriateness of model choices. The prevalence of
	all cancers combined for Italian regions with CRs was estimated and
	projected to the year 2000 as ranging between 1,240 per 100,000 in
	Sicilia and 2,781 in Emilia-Romagna for men, while for women these
	figures were 1,765 in Sicilia and 4,019 in Liguria. Comparison of
	cancer prevalence in CR areas with regional estimates shows quite
	good consistency for Piemonte, Liguria and Lombardia, which means
	that the local CRs (of Torino, Genova and Varese, respectively) are
	representative of their respective regions. Prevalence in Emilia-Romagna
	appears to be rather well represented by only one, the Parma CR,
	of the three local CRs. The southern Italian registries of Latina
	and Ragusa recorded a lower cancer prevalence than was actually estimated
	in their respective regions. DISCUSSION: Cancer registries with a
	longer period of activity showed better agreement between empirical
	and estimated figures due to the more precise information provided,
	particularly regarding survival and incidence trends. In conclusion,
	this work shows the potential of the cancer registries not only to
	represent their population with respect to cancer morbidity but also
	as an invaluable tool to extrapolate this information to the larger
	areas they represent.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with newly diagnosed cancer may request an estimate
	of their prospects for long-term survival. Unfortunately, standard
	estimates of survival may be outdated, because they do not reflect
	recent advances. The authors present a projection method that incorporates
	trends in survival and provides more up-to-date estimates of long-term
	survival for newly diagnosed patients. METHODS: The projection method
	fits a regression model to interval relative survival and includes
	a parameter associated with a trend on diagnosis year. The cumulative
	relative survival rate (CRS) in a target year is calculated by multiplying
	the projected interval survival rates for that year. To investigate
	the predictive ability of the projection approach and to develop
	model-selection rules, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
	and End Results Program and the Connecticut tumor registry were used
	to recreate data that were available at a particular time in the
	past, and those data were used to project survival for specified
	target years. RESULTS: The projection method was better at predicting
	the survival of recently diagnosed patients than current methods,
	especially long-term survival for patients who had disease sites
	with an increasing and stable trend in survival. The authors predicted
	that the 15-year CRS for patients who were diagnosed in 2003 will
	be 61\% for all cancer sites combined, 57\% for colorectal cancer,
	82\% for female breast cancer, 53\% for ovarian cancer, and 97\%
	for prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Although the projection method
	was more speculative than other methods that are aligned more closely
	with current observed data, it offered the possibility of providing
	improved estimates of long-term survival for recently diagnosed patients.
	Caution should be used when applying these methods for cancer sites
	where there has been a dramatic uptake of screening, e.g., prostate
	cancer, for which the projected results may be overly optimistic.},

	consist of many shoots (ramets), and genets are grouped in sites.
	Thus, aphids feeding on tansy can cluster at the level of ramets,
	genets and sites. We studied aphid population dynamics in 1997 and
	2001 and found that within sites: (i). at any time, aphids used only
	a fraction of the available ramets and genets; (ii). at the level
	of ramets, most aphid colonies survived only one week; (iii). at
	the level of genets, mean survival time was less than 4 weeks; and
	(iv). colonization and extinction events occurred throughout the
	season. We sampled aphids in seven sites in the Alsace region, France
	(4-45 km apart) and two sites in Germany in 1999 to study genetic
	structure within and between populations. Genetic analyses using
	nine microsatellite loci showed that: (i). genotypic variability
	was high, (ii). none of the populations was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
	(iii). heterozygote deficits and linkage disequilibria were frequent,
	and (iv). all populations were genetically differentiated, even at
	a small geographical scale. Renewed sampling of the Alsace sites
	in 2001 showed that three populations had become extinct and significant
	genetic changes had occurred in the remaining four populations. The
	frequencies of extinction and colonization events at several spatial
	scales suggest a hierarchical metapopulation structure for M. tanacetaria.
	Frequent population turnover and drift are likely causes for the
	genetic differentiation of M. tanacetaria populations.},

	the required number of patients in a reasonable period of time. While

	the homogeneity of the observed treatment effects across institutions,

	The marginal posterior distributions are estimated by a Markov chain
	Monte Carlo method, that is, Gibbs sampling, to overcome current

	distributional assumption for the random effects is also examined.
	We illustrate the methods with analyses of data from a multi-centre
	cancer clinical trial, which investigated the efficacy of immunochemotherapy
	as an adjuvant treatment after curative resection of gastric cancer.
	In this trial there is little difference in the treatment effects
	across institutions and the treatment is shown to be effective, while
	there appears to be substantial variation in the baseline risk across

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an experimental infection
	of young adults with a history of episodic and exclusive viral wheeze
	(EVW) using human coronavirus, in which 16 of 24 with EVW (15 atopic)
	and 11 of 19 healthy controls (seven atopic) developed a symptomatic
	cold with evidence of infection, but only those with EVW developed
	lower respiratory tract symptoms and increased airway responsiveness.
	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the EVW and control
	groups from this study for inflammatory changes occurring in the
	upper and lower respiratory tracts during the experimental infection,
	in particular, to determine whether eosinophil-driven inflammation
	was associated with EVW. METHODS: Nasal lavage and induced sputum
	were collected prior to inoculation (day 0) and 2, 4 and 17 days
	later. Differential cell counts were performed and supernatant was
	assayed for IL-8, IL-5, IFN-gamma, and eosinophilic cationic protein
	(ECP). RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in
	any measurement at baseline. In both groups, during colds the volume
	of nasal secretion increased as did leucocyte counts in both upper
	and lower respiratory tracts. A modest increase in nasal neutrophil
	count was seen in both EVW and control groups with symptomatic colds
	on day 2 (median (quartile) difference from baseline 5.4 (0.0, 11.0)
	and 1.8 (-1.1, 2.2)x10(4)/mL of secretions, respectively). The change
	in nasal neutrophil counts in all subjects correlated with nasal
	symptom scores. A significant relative increase in sputum differential
	neutrophil count was seen on day 4 in the EVW group with a cold but
	not in controls (mean difference (95\% confidence interval) 20.4
	(9.6, 31.1)\% and 3.1 (-8.2, 14.5)\%, respectively, P<0.01); however,
	this increase did not correlate with lower respiratory tract symptom
	scores. IL-8 increased in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts
	in both EVW and control subjects with colds, the largest change being
	seen on day 4 in the sputum of those with EVW (mean difference from
	baseline (95\% confidence interval) 2.5 (0.55-4.46) ng/mL). Only
	modest changes were seen in IFN-gamma and no changes were seen in
	IL-5 or ECP. None of the results was influenced by the atopic status
	of the subjects in either group. CONCLUSIONS: EVW wheeze is characterized
	by neutrophilic inflammation in both the upper and lower respiratory
	tracts without eosinophilia (even in atopic subjects). IL-8 is likely
	to be an important chemokine in this process. Symptoms and airway
	responsiveness were correlated with change in neutrophils.},

	would cause lower respiratory tract (LRT) changes in adults with
	a history of viral wheeze. Twenty-four viral wheezers (15 atopic)

	monitored for the development of symptoms, changes in airway physiology
	and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20\% fall

	and 6 (4-15), respectively p = 0.014). Sixteen viral wheezers and

  abstract    = {The methodology of cost-effectiveness studies that use a lifetime
	perspective is based on the extrapolation to infinity of the survival
	curves. However, the research in this methodological area is at an
	initial phase. Hence, adequate techniques for survival curve extrapolation
	still need to be devised for handling the different clinical settings
	that can be analysed by cost-effectiveness survival studies. After
	a brief overview of the two most commonly used extrapolation methods
	(Markov decision-tree model and Gompertz technique), we describe
	a new method for expressing lifetime survival in cost-effectiveness
	studies that evaluate cancer patients. Our method extrapolates to
	infinity a traditional survival curve by assigning a normal life
	expectancy to patients (or long-term survivors). In this way, the
	value of mean lifetime survival (MLS) for the patient cohort under
	study can be determined using a lifetime perspective. This value
	can be employed in lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses that compare
	different forms of intervention for that disease condition. A separate
	section of our method compares the overall survival pattern of cured
	and not cured patients with that of a reference healthy population
	to assess the impact of the disease on life expectancy. As an example
	of the application of our method, we reanalysed a survival data set
	reported by Spinolo et al in 1992, that refers to patients with acute
	leukaemia who relapsed after their first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
	and who received a second transplant (n=17, mean age at relapse =
	26 years). The use of our extrapolation method provided the following
	results: MLS for leukaemia patients = 105.9 months per patient or
	8.8 years per patient; MLS for the reference cohort of healthy subjects
	= 583.8 months per patient or 48.6 years per patient. We conclude
	that the extrapolation technique described herein can be useful to
	handle lifetime survival data in cost-effectiveness analysis.},

	in a piecemeal fashion over 15 years. A frequently raised concern
	is the method's 'risk set': each individual is considered to be at
	risk of all recurrent events from the start of the observation period.
	The WLW method often gives estimates that exceed those provided by
	alternative approaches. This paper investigates whether the estimates
	are a consequence of biased estimation, or reflect a particular aspect
	of the treatment effect. Simulation studies show that the WLW method
	infringes the proportional hazards assumption when applied to recurrent
	events data, but that the bias this may cause is not behind the distinctive
	effect estimates. Instead, the method's risk set is demonstrated
	to be responsible, leading to discussion of the interpretation of
	the treatment effect being estimated. Analyses of medical data indicate
	that the infringement of the proportional hazards assumption is not
	necessarily greater than that experienced with other applications
	of proportional hazards regression and need not prohibit the application

  pages = {184--202},
  abstract = {Hodgkin's lymphoma is a unique neoplasm of B lymphocytes. Recent data
	provide new understandings of the pathogenesis and options for staging
	and therapy of the disease. Three specific topics are addressed in
	this chapter. In Section I, Dr. Richard Ambinder reviews implications
	of the relationship of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
	This relation includes varying geographic epidemiologic associations,
	including varying associations with the clinical syndrome of infectious
	mononucleosis. There are plausible mechanisms, including processes
	initiated by viral proteins, by which EBV might lead to tumorigenesis.
	These mechanisms include promotion of genetic instability and alteration
	of normal processes of apoptosis. In addition to an epidemiologic
	association and potential role in pathogenesis, viral antigens may
	pose theoretical targets for anti-cancer therapies, including vaccination.
	In Section II, Dr. Sigrid Stroobants describes the potential role
	of positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning. By assessing differences
	in the metabolic activities of cancer cells, PET scanning may be
	superior to computerized tomographic scanning, which is limited to
	showing structural anatomical abnormalities. In patients with Hodgkin's
	and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, PET scanning has been tested as an initial
	staging tool, to assess the rate of therapeutic response from a prognostic
	perspective, and to differentiate residual tumor from fibrotic masses
	in patients who have completed therapy. Particularly in assessing
	the nature of a residual mass seen with other post-therapeutic imaging
	modalities, PET scanning may provide unique information; very high
	negative predictive values have been reported. However, before this
	technology can be recommended for incorporation into standard management,
	properly conducted prospective trials are required to better evaluate
	the clinical utility of PET with respect to eventual patient outcomes.
	In Section III, Dr. Ralph Meyer reviews current data regarding the
	management of patients with limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma. Over
	the past decade, standard treatment has evolved to consist of combined-modality
	therapy that includes an abbreviated course of chemotherapy and involved-field
	radiation. As this therapy continues to include radiation therapy,
	patients will remain at risk of long-term toxicities that include
	the development of second cancers and cardiovascular events. These
	"late-effects" now account for more deaths than those attributed
	to progressive Hodgkin's lymphoma. Comparative data testing the role
	of chemotherapy alone are now available and demonstrate that omission
	of radiation therapy results in small but statistically significant
	reduction in disease control, but no detectable differences in overall
	survival. Further follow-up will clarify whether chemotherapy alone
	is the preferred treatment option; at present patients should be
	informed of the trade-offs involved in choosing between this option
	and combined modality therapy.},

	Score (SAPS II) and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score were collected

	associated with the outcome were selected using a stepwise Cox model.
	The time to acquisition of the first LOP was then introduced in the
	final model as a time-dependent covariate. The analysis was stratified
	by ICU center. Finally, as initial antibiotic therapy could have
	an impact on the increased risk of death induced by LOP, the Cox
	model was applied again introducing LOP immediately adequately treated

	covariates.Late-onset pneumonia developed in 89 patients (12\%).
	A McCabe score of more than 1, SAPS II score and increases in SAPS

	as compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel, with respect to progression-free
	survival in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for progression
	or death, 0.74; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001).
	In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the epidermal
	growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation, progression-free survival
	was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than
	among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for
	progression or death, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P<0.001), whereas
	in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation,
	progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who
	received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or
	death with gefitinib, 2.85; 95\% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; P<0.001). The
	most common adverse events were rash or acne (in 66.2\% of patients)
	and diarrhea (46.6\%) in the gefitinib group and neurotoxic effects
	(69.9\%), neutropenia (67.1\%), and alopecia (58.4\%) in the carboplatin-paclitaxel
	group. CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel
	as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers
	or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of
	a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome
	with gefitinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00322452.)},

	Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) C18-C20) between 1996
	and 2004 in England, Norway and Sweden were included in this population-based
	study of patients with colorectal cancer. The main outcome measures
	were 5-year cumulative relative period of survival and excess death
	rates stratified by age and period of follow-up.The survival of English
	patients with colorectal cancer was significantly lower than was
	observed in both Norway and Sweden. Five-year age-standardised colon
	cancer relative survival was 51.1\% (95\% CI 50.1\% to 52.0\%) in
	England compared with 57.9\% (95\% CI 55.2\% to 60.5\%) in Norway
	and 59.9\% (95\% CI 57.7\% to 62.0\%) in Sweden. Five-year rectal
	cancer survival was 52.3\% (95\% CI 51.1\% to 53.5\%) in England
	compared with 60.7\% (95\% CI 57.0\% to 64.2\%) and 59.8\% (95\%
	CI 56.9\% to 62.6\%) in Norway and Sweden, respectively. The lower
	survival for colon cancer in England was primarily due to a high
	number of excess deaths among older patients in the first 3 months
	after diagnosis. In patients with rectal cancer, excess deaths remained
	elevated until 2 years of follow-up. If the lower excess death rate
	in Norway applied in the English population, then 890 (13.6\%) and
	654 (16.8\%) of the excess deaths in the colon and rectal cancer
	populations, respectively, could have been prevented at 5 years follow-up.
	Most of these avoidable deaths occurred shortly after diagnosis.There
	was significant variation in survival between the countries, with
	the English population experiencing a poorer outcome, primarily due
	to a relatively higher number of excess deaths in older patients
	in the short term after diagnosis. It seems likely, therefore, that
	in England a greater proportion of the population present with more
	rapidly fatal disease (especially in the older age groups) than in
	Norway or Sweden.},

	marked seasonal changes in its body adiposity. The aim of this study
	was to investigate the roles of melatonin, leptin, ghrelin and growth
	hormone (GH) in weight regulation and reproduction of the species.
	Sixteen raccoon dogs were treated with continuous-release melatonin
	implants in Aug 2000 and in Feb 2001 (the MEL group) and 16 animals
	were sham-operated (the SHAM group). Half of the raccoon dogs were
	fasted between Nov 27(th) 2000 and Jan 25(th) 2001. The autumnal
	results have been previously published and this paper reports the
	vernal data. The leptin concentrations of the SHAM females were high
	before the mating season, decreased before estrus, increased during
	gestation and reduced after parturition. The MEL females had higher
	leptin concentrations than the SHAM females in early March, whereas
	the MEL males had lower leptin concentrations than the SHAM males
	in late March. Also the ghrelin and GH concentrations of the SHAM
	females decreased before estrus. Continuous melatonin treatment advanced
	the vernal rise in the ghrelin concentrations and the vernal drop
	and the subsequent rise in the GH concentrations of the females.
	Melatonin also increased their body mass indices from July to Aug
	2001, indicating that it triggers the autumnal accumulation of fat
	in the species.},

  abstract = {In the current era of ever-increasing health care costs, economic
	analyses are an essential component in the comprehensive evaluation
	of new medical interventions. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)--the
	most common form of economic analysis used in medicine--aids policy-makers
	in determining how to allocate finite health care dollars among possible
	alternative therapies. CEA relates the incremental benefits of a
	new technology to its incremental costs in a cost-effectiveness (CE)
	ratio. Although the generally agreed-upon standard of presentation
	for the CE ratio is the lifetime perspective (incremental lifetime
	cost to add one life year), this perspective presents an obvious
	challenge to the statistical analyst. Most large clinical trials
	collect limited follow-up data, and yet their findings form the basis
	of therapeutic recommendations that often extend far beyond the limits
	of the empirical data. Although clinical practice guidelines do not
	yet require explicit modeling to examine the long-term implications
	of their recommendations, health policy analyses routinely rely upon
	such extrapolations. This paper describes methods for using empirical
	patient-level data to extrapolate survival in large clinical trials
	and cohorts beyond a limited follow-up period in which most patients
	remain alive in order to estimate the entire survival distribution
	for a cohort of patients. We accomplish this task through a novel
	combination of models that estimate the hazard rate not only as a
	function of time but also as a function of patient age. Extrapolation
	of survival beyond a limited time frame is made possible by capitalizing
	on the extensive latitude of survival information available across
	the range of ages represented in the data. Variations in approach
	are presented, and issues arising in these analyses are discussed.
	The proposed methodology is developed, applied, and evaluated in
	both a large clinical trial cohort with 5-year follow-up on over
	23,000 patients and a large observational database with long-term
	follow-up on over 4000 patients.},

	studies in coronary heart disease (CHD) and potential advantages
	compared with all-cause survival methods. Survival after myocardial

	methods. Neither method is able to assess the impact of the disease
	or condition of interest in comparison with expected survival in
	a similar population. Relative survival, the ratio of the observed
	and the expected survival rates, is applied routinely in cancer studies
	and may improve on current methods for assessment of survival in
	CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cohort of subjects after a first
	recorded acute MI, we discuss the application of relative survival
	in CHD and illustrate a number of the key issues. We compare the
	findings from relative survival with those obtained using Cox proportional
	and non-proportional hazards models in standard all-cause survival.
	Estimated survival rates are higher using relative survival models
	compared with all-cause methods. CONCLUSION: Estimates obtained from
	all-cause mortality fail to disentangle mortality associated with
	the condition of interest from that due to all other causes. Relative
	survival gives an estimate of survival due to the disease of interest

  abstract = {Continued survival of most animal species depends on population management
	and active protection. It is generally agreed that, in order to avoid
	extinction of endangered species, ex situ and in situ conservation
	must be developed in tandem. However, even though many recommendations
	have been put forward to promote the survival of captive populations,
	some rapidly become extinct due to loss of genetic diversity (drift
	effect). Genetic markers, such as random amplified polymorphic DNA
	(RAPD) markers, can be applied to rapid testing of many individuals.
	They also permit analysis of very small amounts of DNA, when small
	species such as mouse lemurs (Microcebus) are to be tested. Using
	RAPD markers, we compare genetic diversity in four captive groups
	of Microcebus murinus to that in a sample of 70 wild mouse lemurs.
	Following the principles of Mendelian inheritance, each amplified
	fragment of DNA may be considered as a 'locus' (or an amplifying
	site). The series of bands amplified by a particular primer in any
	individual is referred to as the individual's 'profile'. We tested
	5 primers, or, in the above terms, we studied 98 different 'loci'.
	Results showed that the captive groups had lost genetic information
	with respect to the wild sample. Among the four captive groups, the
	loss of genetic diversity varied according to their number of founders
	and/or the management of their captive reproduction. Our study of
	polymorphism permitted us to establish tools for the genetic management
	of captive breeding, and for the determination of paternity which
	frequently give better results than behavioural studies; and simulation
	of introductions or departures of individuals in one very monomorphic
	group permitted estimation of future increases in its genetic diversity.},

	clinical stage IA to IIB Hodgkin's disease. Overall survival was

	hazards from the Cox proportional hazards model. Occasionally, the
	investigators will also provide a graphical representation of adjusted
	survival curves based on regression estimates and the average covariate
	values in the study groups. In this paper, the authors review the
	limitations of this approach and examine alternative approaches to
	obtaining adjusted survival curves that have been proposed. Furthermore,
	a new method to obtain multivariate adjusted survival curves is described.
	This method is based on direct adjustment of the observed conditional
	probability of survival at the time of each event. When an unexposed
	group is used as a standard for adjusting an exposed group, the survival
	curve in the exposed group is adjusted to the covariate distribution
	among the unexposed at the time of the event. This method has the
	advantage over the average covariate method of allowing for the possibility
	that the adjusted survival curves differ in shape. The method can
	handle multiple fixed or time-dependent categorical covariates as
	well as left truncated data, and it allows for estimation of confidence
	intervals. The authors have written a macro in SAS language that
	produces the adjusted survival estimates and graphs. This macro is

	who had surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm in Western Australia
	during 1985-94. DESIGN: Population based study. SETTING: Western
	Australia. SUBJECTS: All patients who had had surgery for abdominal
	aortic aneurysm in Western Australia during 1985-94. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Morbidity and mortality data of patients admitted and surgically
	treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm in Western Australia during
	1985-94. Elective, ruptured, and acute non-ruptured cases were analysed
	separately. Independent analyses for sex and patients aged 80 years
	or more were also undertaken. Postoperative (>30 days) relative survival
	was assessed against age and sex matched controls. RESULTS: Overall,
	1475 (1257 men, 218 women) cases were identified. The crude five
	year survival after elective surgery, including deaths within 30
	days of surgery, was 79\% for both men and women. When compared with
	a matched population the five year relative survival after elective
	surgery was 94.9\% (95\% confidence interval 89.9\% to 99.9\%) for
	men but only 88.0\% (76.3\% to 99.7\%) for women. The five year relative
	survival of those aged 80 years and over was good: 116.6\% (89.1\%
	to 144.0\%) compared with 92.4\% (87.7\% to 97.0\%) for those under
	80 years of age (men and women combined). Cardiovascular disease
	caused 57.8\% of the 341 deaths after 30 days. CONCLUSION: In a condition
	such as abdominal aortic aneurysm, which occurs in elderly patients,
	relative survival is more clinically meaningful than crude survival.
	The five year relative survival in cases of elective and ruptured
	abdominal aortic aneurysm was better in men than in women. This is
	probably because of greater comorbidity in women with abdominal aortic
	aneurysm and this deserves more attention in the future. The long
	term survival outcome in octogenarians supports surgery in selected
	cases.},

	data sets, such as those collected by cancer registries. Restriction

	had no data been missing. 'Naive' methods for handling missing data,
	such as restriction of the analysis to complete records or creation
	of a 'missing' category, have drawbacks that can invalidate the conclusions
	from the analysis. We offer a tutorial on modern methods for handling
	missing data in relative survival analysis.We estimated relative
	survival for 29 563 colorectal cancer patients who were diagnosed
	between 1997 and 2004 and registered in the North West Cancer Intelligence
	Service. The method of multiple imputation (MI) was applied to account
	for the common example of incomplete stage at diagnosis, under the
	missing at random (MAR) assumption. Multivariable regression with
	a generalized linear model and Poisson error structure was then used
	to estimate the excess hazard of death of the colorectal cancer patients,
	over and above the background mortality, adjusting for significant
	predictors of mortality.Incomplete information on stage, morphology
	and grade meant that only 55\% of the data could be included in the
	'complete-case' analysis. All cases could be included after indicator
	method (IM) or MI method. Handling missing data by MI produced a
	significantly lower estimate of the excess mortality for stage, morphology
	and grade, with the largest reductions occurring for late-stage and
	high-grade tumours, when compared with the results of complete-case
	analysis.In complete-case analysis, almost 50\% of the information
	could not be included, and with the IM, all records with missing
	values for stage were combined into a single 'missing' category.
	We show that MI methods greatly improved the results by exploiting
	all the information in the incomplete records. This method also helped
	to ensure efficient inferences about survival were made from the
	multivariate regression analyses.},

	women, whereas in women from the general population, hysterectomy
	plus BSO may increase the risk of overall mortality. The effect of
	hysterectomy plus BSO on women previously diagnosed with breast cancer
	is unknown. We used data from a population-base data linkage study
	of all women diagnosed with primary breast cancer in Queensland,
	Australia between 1997 and 2008 (n = 21,067). We fitted flexible
	parametric breast cancer-specific and overall survival models with
	95\% confidence intervals (also known as Royston-Parmar models) to
	assess the impact of risk-reducing surgery (removal of uterus, one
	or both ovaries). We also stratified analyses by age 20-49 and 50-79
	years, respectively. Overall, 1,426 women (7\%) underwent risk-reducing
	surgery (13\% of premenopausal women and 3\% of postmenopausal women).
	No women who had risk-reducing surgery compared to 171 who did not
	have risk-reducing surgery developed a gynaecological cancer. Overall,
	3,165 (15\%) women died, including 2,195 (10\%) from breast cancer.
	Hysterectomy plus BSO was associated with significantly reduced risk
	of death overall [adjusted hazard ration (HR), 0.69; 95\% confidence
	interval (CI), 0.53-0.89; p = 0.005]. Risk reduction was greater
	among premenopausal women, whose risk of death halved (HR, 0.45;
	95\% CI, 0.25-0.79; p < 0.006). This was largely driven by reduction
	in breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.79;
	p < 0.006). This population-based study found that risk-reducing
	surgery halved the mortality risk for premenopausal breast cancer
	patients. Replication of our results in independent cohorts and subsequently
	randomised trials are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Episodic wheeze triggered by viral colds is common in
	children aged between 1 and 5 years (preschool viral wheeze). Most
	affected children are asymptomatic by age 6 years. Persistence of
	wheeze is associated with above-average systemic eosinophil priming.
	Use of parental-initiated oral prednisolone is recommended at the
	first sign of preschool viral wheeze. However, evidence for this
	treatment strategy is conflicting. We therefore aimed to assess the
	efficacy of a short course of oral prednisolone for preschool viral
	wheeze, with stratification for systemic eosinophil priming. METHODS:
	Children aged 1-5 years admitted to hospital with viral wheeze were
	allocated to either a high-primed or low-primed stratum according
	to amounts of serum eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil protein
	X, and randomised to parent-initiated prednisolone (20 mg one daily
	for 5 days) or placebo for the next episode. The primary outcomes
	were the 7-day mean daytime and night-time respiratory symptom scores,
	which were analysed by mean differences between treatment groups.
	FINDINGS: 108 children were randomised to placebo and 109 to prednisolone.
	Outcome data were available for 120 (78\%) of 153 children who had
	a further episode of viral wheeze, of whom 51 received prednisolone
	and 69 placebo. Mean daytime (difference in means -0.01 [-0.22 to
	0.20]) and night-time (0.10 [-0.12 to 0.32]) respiratory symptom
	scores and need for hospital admission did not differ between treatment
	groups. Within the high-primed (n=59) and low-primed (n=61) strata
	there was no difference in primary outcome between treatment groups.
	INTERPRETATION: There is no clear benefit of a short course of parent-initiated
	oral prednisolone for viral wheeze in children aged 1-5 years even
	in those with above-average eosinophil priming.},

  abstract = {In general, elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
	(NHL) have a less favourable prognosis than younger patients. Established
	predictors of prognosis in NHL are less discriminatory in the elderly,
	which is why there is a need for additional markers giving guidance
	on treatment decisions and prediction of outcome. The expected length
	of life of an individual in the general population is intimately
	associated with that of his/her parents. The aim of this study was
	to test the hypothesis that parental longevity is associated with
	improved outcome also among elderly patients with aggressive NHL
	and thus serves as an easily accessible non-disease associated prognostic
	factor. A total of 220 patients ( > 60 years) with aggressive NHL
	with a median age of 71 years (range 60-86) were included. Patients
	were randomized to receive CHOP or CNOP (doxorubicin replaced with
	mitoxantrone) chemotherapy with or without the addition of granulocyte
	colony-stimulating factor. The median follow-up time was 56 (19-89)
	months. Parental data regarding age at death were available through
	parish offices for 425 (97\%) parents. Relative risk (RR) of death
	(disease-specific and all-cause) associated with parental lifespan
	was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses,
	with adjustment for sex, age, prognostic index, symptoms, and calendar
	period of diagnosis. Maternal lifespan below (versus above) median
	was associated with a borderline significant reduced disease-specific
	(adjusted RR of death from NHL = 1.5; 95\% confidence interval 1.0-2.1)
	and overall survival. The effect of maternal lifespan was somewhat
	more pronounced in patients receiving CHOP than CNOP treatment. Paternal
	lifespan below the median was associated with a borderline significant
	increased disease-specific (adjusted RR of death from NHL = 0.8 [0.5-1.0])
	and overall survival. Combined, maternal, and paternal lifespan had
	little impact on survival. These effects were true also when CHOP
	and CNOP treated patients were analysed separately. Maternal and
	paternal lifespan may predict survival in NHL, but with opposing
	effects. At present parental age appears not to be a clinically useful
	predictor of prognosis in the elderly with aggressive NHL.},

	age group. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
	trial comparing a 5-day course of oral prednisolone (10 mg once a
	day for children 10 to 24 months of age and 20 mg once a day for
	older children) with placebo in 700 children between the ages of
	10 months and 60 months. The children presented to three hospitals
	in England with an attack of wheezing associated with a viral infection;
	687 children were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (343
	in the prednisolone group and 344 in the placebo group). The primary
	outcome was the duration of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were
	the score on the Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure, albuterol
	use, and a 7-day symptom score. RESULTS: There was no significant
	difference in the duration of hospitalization between the placebo
	group and the prednisolone group (13.9 hours vs. 11.0 hours; ratio
	of geometric means, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval, 0.77 to 1.05)
	or in the interval between hospital admission and signoff for discharge
	by a physician. In addition, there was no significant difference
	between the two study groups for any of the secondary outcomes or

  abstract = {The proportional hazards (PH) model is routinely employed for the
	analysis of time-to-event data in medical research when it is required
	to assess the effect of an intervention in the presence of covariates.
	The assumption of PH required for the PH approach may not hold, especially
	in circumstances where the effect of the intervention is to delay
	or accelerate the onset of an event rather than to reduce or increase
	the overall proportion of subjects who observe the event through
	time. If the assumption of PH is violated, the results from a PH
	model will be difficult to generalize to situations where the length
	of follow-up is different to that used in the analysis. It is also
	difficult to translate the results into the effect upon the expected
	median duration of illness for a patient in a clinical setting. The
	accelerated failure time (AFT) approach is an alternative strategy
	for the analysis of time-to-event data and can be suitable even when
	hazards are not proportional and this family of models contains a
	certain form of PH as a special case. The framework can allow for
	different forms of the hazard function and may provide a closer description
	of the data in certain circumstances. In addition, the results of
	the AFT model may be easier to interpret and more relevant to clinicians,
	as they can be directly translated into expected reduction or prolongation
	of the median time to event, unlike the hazard ratio. We recommend
	that consideration is given to an AFT modelling approach in the analysis
	of time-to-event data in medical research.},

	white women with BPs of at least 140 or 90 mmHg at the antenatal
	clinic after 20 weeks' gestation, who underwent obstetric day unit
	and 24-hour automated BP monitoring on the same day. Automated measurement
	was obtained every half hour for 24 hours using a commercially available
	device that had been previously validated in pregnancy. RESULTS:
	At the traditional BP cutoff point (140/90 mmHg), the relative risk
	for subsequent development of adverse obstetric outcome was greatest
	for automated BP measurement: The relationships between outcome and
	automated diastolic BP were all statistically significant: proteinuria
	(P = .034), preterm delivery (P < .001), birth weight below the tenth
	percentile (P = .001), admission to the special care neonatal unit
	(P = .001), and cesarean delivery (P = .007). CONCLUSION: Automated
	BP measurement appears to improve the identification of patients
	who are at high risk of poor obstetric outcome. Automated BP measurement
	is worthy of further evaluation as an antenatal screening and diagnostic

  abstract = {Cure rate estimation is an important issue in clinical trials for
	diseases such as lymphoma and breast cancer and mixture models are
	the main statistical methods. In the last decade, mixture models
	under different distributions, such as exponential, Weibull, log-normal
	and Gompertz, have been discussed and used. However, these models
	involve stronger distributional assumptions than is desirable and
	inferences may not be robust to departures from these assumptions.
	In this paper, a mixture model is proposed using the generalized
	F distribution family. Although this family is seldom used because
	of computational difficulties, it has the advantage of being very
	flexible and including many commonly used distributions as special
	cases. The generalised F mixture model can relax the usual stronger
	distributional assumptions and allow the analyst to uncover structure
	in the data that might otherwise have been missed. This is illustrated
	by fitting the model to data from large-scale clinical trials with
	long follow-up of lymphoma patients. Computational problems with
	the model and model selection methods are discussed. Comparison of
	maximum likelihood estimates with those obtained from mixture models
	under other distributions are included.},

	automated blood pressure monitoring over obstetric day unit conventional
	blood pressure measurement in the assessment of hypertensive pregnancies.
	STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, observational study was carried out
	in two large teaching hospitals. Three hundred and forty-eight women
	with a confirmed clinic blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg were
	recruited. Conventional blood pressure measurements (< or =5) were
	obtained on the day unit and simultaneously an ambulatory blood pressure
	monitor was applied for 24 hours. The predictive ability of day unit
	assessment (blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg) and automated blood pressure
	monitoring (blood pressure > 130/85 mm Hg) was compared. Principal
	outcome measures included the occurrence of severe hypertension (>
	160/110 mm Hg) and proteinuria (> 500 mg or 2+) within (a) 2 weeks
	and (b) the remainder of the pregnancy. Thompson's method was used
	to compare sensitivity and specificity of the day unit blood pressure
	and automated blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Three hundred and
	forty-eight women were recruited to the study. The comparison between
	automated blood pressure monitoring and conventional blood pressure
	measurement for both sensitivity and specificity for systolic and
	diastolic blood pressure revealed increased sensitivity and decreased
	specificity with automated blood pressure monitoring for all principal
	outcomes except development of proteinuria for systolic blood pressure.
	Sensitivity for the outcomes was increased with automated blood pressure
	monitoring by between 14\% and 27\% for systolic blood pressure and
	between 7\% and 39\% for diastolic blood pressure, with the greatest
	improvement seen for the development of severe hypertension within
	2 weeks of assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In the assessment of hypertensive
	pregnancies, automated blood pressure measurement was a significantly
	better predictor (compared with conventional day unit assessment)
	for the development of severe hypertension within 2 weeks of assessment
	for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.},

	Such endpoints as heart failure, death due to a specific disease,

	due to a prior occurrence of a different type of event (such as death
	from another cause). The event which hinders or changes the possibility
	of observing the event of interest is called a competing risk. The
	usual techniques for time-to-event analysis applied in the presence
	of competing risks give biased or uninterpretable results. The estimation
	of the probability of the event therefore needs to be calculated
	using specific techniques such as the cumulative incidence function
	introduced by Kalbfleisch and Prentice. The model introduced by Fine
	and Gray can be applied to test a covariate when competing risks
	are present. Using specific techniques for the analysis of competing

  abstract = {The goal of relative survival methodology is to compare the survival
	experience of a cohort with that of the background population. Most
	often an additive excess hazard model is employed, which assumes
	that each person's hazard is a sum of 2 components-the population
	hazard obtained from life tables and an excess hazard attributable
	to the specific condition. Usually covariate effects on the excess
	hazard are assumed to have a proportional hazards structure with
	parametrically modelled baseline. In this paper, we introduce a new
	fitting procedure using the expectation-maximization algorithm, treating
	the cause of death as missing data. The method requires no assumptions
	about the baseline excess hazard thus reducing the risk of bias through
	misspecification. It accommodates the possibility of knowledge of
	cause of death for some patients, and as a side effect, the method
	yields an estimate of the ratio between the excess and the population
	hazard for each subject. More importantly, it estimates the baseline
	excess hazard flexibly with no additional degrees of freedom spent.
	Finally, it is a generalization of the Cox model, meaning that all
	the wealth of options in existing software for the Cox model can
	be used in relative survival. The method is applied to a data set
	on survival after myocardial infarction, where it shows how a particular
	form of the hazard function could be missed using the existing methods.},

	Furthermore, the commonly used interpretation of the relative survival

	these basic problems. The population quantities of the traditional

	We then propose a new estimator of net survival probability that
	enables the desired comparability between countries. The new estimator

  abstract = {It is common in population-based cancer registries to use the relative
	survival ratio to estimate patients' probabilities of surviving if
	their cancer were the only cause of death. Results from the recently
	proposed new methods of age-standardisation can be interpreted as
	ratios between the observed and expected survival proportions. Like
	the non-standardised ratios, these age-standardised relative survival
	ratios have, however, the desired probability interpretation only
	under a specific condition. The condition involved is the survival
	with respect to other causes up to the given point of follow-up.
	With different lengths of follow-up, this condition is also different.
	As a consequence, the non-standardised relative survival ratios and
	those standardised with the two newest methods produce, for different
	lengths of follow-up, mutually incomparable estimates with respect
	to age. Not accounting for this may, for example, lead to erroneous
	conclusions about the cure of the patients. The traditional method
	of age-standardisation does not have this problem of incomparability.
	Results of relative survival analyses of data from the Finnish Cancer
	Registry are used to illustrate this issue. To avoid overinterpretation
	and confusion, the different interpretations of the relative survival
	ratios, both non-standardised and age-standardised, must be known.
	For example, the very popular cumulative relative survival curves,
	consisting of consecutive cumulative relative survival ratios, should
	not be produced for the non-standardised ratios or for ratios age-standardised
	with the two newest methods. In practical applications, it is crucial
	to know which method of standardisation, and not only which standard
	population, has been in use.},

  abstract = {Background:Relative survival after cancer in Finland is at the highest
	level observed in Europe and has, in general, been on a steady increase.
	The aim of this study is to assess whether the high survival is equally
	shared by different population subgroups and to estimate the possible
	gains that might be achieved if equity prevailed.Materials and method:The
	educational level and occupation before the cancer diagnosis of patients
	diagnosed in Finland in 1971-2005 was derived from an antecedent
	population census. The cancers were divided into 27 site categories.
	Cancer (cause)-specific 5-year survival proportions were calculated
	for three patient categories based on the educational level and for
	an occupational group of potentially health-conscious patients (physicians,
	nurses, teachers etc.). Proportions of avoidable deaths were derived
	by assuming that the patients from the two lower education categories
	would have the same mortality owing to cancer, as those from the
	highest educational category. Estimates were also made by additionally
	assuming that even the mortalities owing to other causes of death
	were all equal to those in the highest category.Results:For almost
	all the sites considered, survival was consistently highest for patients
	with the highest education and lowest for those with only basic education.
	The potentially health-conscious patients had an even higher survival.
	The differences were, in part, attributable to less favourable distributions
	of tumour stages in the lower education categories. In 1996-2005,
	4-7\% of the deaths in Finnish cancer patients could have potentially
	been avoided during the first 5-year period after diagnosis, if all
	the patients had the same cancer mortality as the patients with the
	highest educational background. The proportion would have also been
	much higher, 8-11\%, if, in addition, the mortality from other causes
	had been the same as that in the highest educational category.Interpretation:Even
	in a potentially equitable society with high health care standards,
	marked inequalities persist in cancer survival. Earlier cancer diagnosis
	and the ability to cope within the health care system may be a partly
	relevant explanation, but personal habits and lifestyles also have
	a role, particularly for the cancer patients' mortality from other
	causes of death than cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online

	causes of failure include the estimation of treatment or exposure
	effects on specific failure types, the study of interrelations among
	failure types, and the estimation of failure rates for some causes
	given the removal of certain other failure types. The usual formulation
	of these problems is in terms of conceptual or latent failure times
	for each failure type. This approach is criticized on the basis of
	unwarranted assumptions, lack of physical interpretation and identifiability
	problems. An alternative approach utilizing cause-specific hazard
	functions for observable quantities, including time-dependent covariates,
	is proposed. Cause-specific hazard functions are shown to be the
	basic estimable quantities in the competing risks framework. A method,
	involving the estimation of parameters that relate time-dependent
	risk indicators for some causes to cause-specific hazard functions
	for other causes, is proposed for the study of interrelations among
	failure types. Further, it is argued that the problem of estimation
	of failure rates under the removal of certain causes is not well
	posed until a mechanism for cause removal is specified. Following
	such a specification, one will sometimes be in a position to make
	sensible extrapolations from available data to situations involving
	cause removal. A clinical program in bone marrow transplantation
	for leukemia provides a setting for discussion and illustration of
	each of these ideas. Failure due to censoring in a survivorship study
	leads to further discussion.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus exhibit
	a daily rhythm in spontaneous electrical activity. Essentially two
	methods have been employed to record this circadian rhythm: (1) an
	in vitro brain slice technique and (2) in vivo multiunit recordings.
	Reentrainment of a circadian output to a shifted light:dark cycle
	commonly takes several cycles (depending on the amount of shift)
	until completed. Such a resetting kinetic has also been shown to
	be valid for SCN electrical activity if recorded in vivo. In an in
	vitro slice preparation, however, pharmacologically induced resetting
	is much faster and lacks transients; that is, a shift is completed
	within one cycle. This study was designed to probe for the presence
	of transients in the neuronal activity of the SCN in a brain slice
	preparation. The authors exposed Djungarian hamsters to an 8-h advanced
	or delayed light:dark cycle and monitored wheel-running activity
	during reentrainment. Additional groups of identically treated hamsters
	were used to record the pattern of spontaneous neuronal activity
	within the SCN using the brain slice preparation. Neuronal activity
	exhibited the usual rhythm with high firing rates during the projected
	day and low firing rates during the projected night. However, following
	1 day of exposure to the 8-h advanced light:dark cycle, this rhythm
	disappeared in 6 of 7 slices. Rhythmicity was still absent following
	3 days of exposure to the advanced light:dark cycle (n = 4). By contrast,
	3 of 7 slices prepared from hamsters exposed to a delayed light:dark
	cycle for 3 days exhibited a daily rhythm in electrical activity.
	Although pharmacological agents reset the in vitro SCN neuronal activity
	almost instantaneously and in in vivo studies a stable phase relationship
	to a shifted light:dark cycle occurs gradually over several cycles,
	the authors did not detect either of these patterns. Such differences
	in resetting kinetics (e.g., rapid resetting, gradual reentrainment,
	temporary lack of measurable rhythmicity) may be due to (a) application
	of a resetting stimulus in vivo versus in vitro, (b) duration of
	the resetting stimulus, (c) the nature of the resetting stimulus,
	or (d) the recording technique employed.},

	Five-year relative survival was estimated for cohorts of patients

	method to more recent incidence data from 32 cancer registries to

	from 1988 to 1999 for all cancers combined and for every cancer site,
	except cervical cancer. However, survival increased at a slower rate
	in the elderly, so that the gap between younger and older patients
	widened, particularly for prostate cancer in men and for all considered
	cancers except cervical cancer in women. For breast and prostate
	cancers, the increasing gap was likely attributable to a larger use
	of, respectively, mammographic screening and PSA test in middle-aged
	with respect to the elderly. In the period analysis of the most recent
	data, relative survival was much higher in middle-aged patients than
	in the elderly. The differences were higher for breast and gynaecological
	cancers, and for prostate cancer. Most of this age gap was due to
	a very large difference in survival after the 1st year following
	the diagnosis. Differences were much smaller for conditional 5-year
	relative survival among patients who had already survived the first
	year. The increase of survival in elderly men is encouraging but
	the lesser improvement in women and, in particular, the widening

	increasingly important. Population-based survival trends provide
	a key insight into the overall effectiveness of the health system,
	alongside trends in incidence and mortality. For this purpose, we
	aimed to provide a unique measure of cancer survival.In this observational
	study, we analysed trends in survival with population-based data
	for 7ÃÂÃÂ·2 million adults diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive
	malignancy in England and Wales during 1971-2011 and followed up
	to the end of 2012. We constructed a survival index for all cancers
	combined using data from the National Cancer Registry and the Welsh
	Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. The index is designed
	to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients
	with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in
	each sex. We analysed trends in the cancer survival index at 1, 5,
	and 10 years after diagnosis for the selected periods 1971-72, 1980-81,
	1990-91, 2000-01, 2005-06, and 2010-11. We also estimated trends
	in age-sex-adjusted survival for each cancer. We define the difference
	in net survival between the oldest (75-99 years) and youngest (15-44
	years) patients as the age gap in survival. We evaluated the absolute
	change (\%) in the age gap since 1971.The overall index of net survival
	increased substantially during the 40-year period 1971-2011, both
	in England and in Wales. For patients diagnosed in 1971-72, the index
	of net survival was 50\% at 1 year after diagnosis. 40 years later,
	the same value of 50\% was predicted at 10 years after diagnosis.
	The average 10\% survival advantage for women persisted throughout
	this period. Predicted 10-year net survival adjusted for age and
	sex for patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2011 ranged from 1ÃÂÃÂ·1\%
	for pancreatic cancer to 98ÃÂÃÂ·2\% for testicular cancer. Net survival
	for the oldest patients (75-99 years) was persistently lower than
	for the youngest (15-44 years), even after adjustment for the much
	higher mortality from causes other than cancer in elderly people.These
	findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term
	net survival from all cancers combined in both England and Wales.
	The net survival index provides a convenient, single number that
	summarises the overall patterns of cancer survival in any one population,
	in each calendar period, for young and old men and women and for
	a wide range of cancers with very disparate survival. The persistent
	sex difference is partly due to a more favourable cancer distribution
	in women than men. The very wide differences in survival for different
	cancers, and the persistent age gap in survival, suggest the need
	for renewed efforts to improve cancer outcomes. Future monitoring
	of the cancer survival index will not be possible unless the current
	crisis of public concern about sharing of individual data for public
	health research can be resolved.Cancer Research UK.},

	ethane or KD was studied in primary rat hepatocyte cultures exposed
	to iron-citrate. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and malondialdehyde
	(MDA) production were measured as indexes of cytotoxicity. Cell viability
	was evaluated using the [3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyl
	tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) reduction test. To demonstrate that this
	chelator was able to decrease iron uptake or increase iron release
	from the hepatocytes, labelled cells were obtained by maintaining
	the cultures in the presence of 0.02 microM 55Fe-citrate. The efficacy
	of KD was compared to desferrioxamine B (DFO) at stoechiometry concentrations.
	After 24 h of exposure to 50 microM of iron-citrate, a significant
	release of LDH and MDA was observed. Cell viability was also significantly
	decreased. When 100 microM of KD were added at the same time as iron,
	LDH and MDA release was decreased and cell viability was improved.
	In the presence of the same chelator concentration, a net decrease
	of iron uptake by the cells was observed as attested by the low intracellular
	55Fe level. Moreover, in the 55Fe loaded hepatocytes, the chelator
	increased the iron extracellular level indicating its iron release
	effect from the cells. In all tested experimental conditions, the
	efficacy of 100 microM of the dihydroxamate chelator KD was close
	to that of 50 microM of the trihydroxamate chelator DFO. In conclusion,
	KD is effective at a level comparable to DFO in protecting rat hepatocytes
	against the toxic effect of iron-citrate by decreasing the uptake
	of the metal and increasing its release from the cells. This synthetic
	compound appears to have some potential therapeutical interest and

	pathological node (PN) and tumour residue (TR) status were studied.
	Event free survival probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
	method. Cure models under proportional and non-proportional hazard
	assumptions following log normal distribution for survival time were
	used to estimate both the cure fraction and the survival function
	for the uncured.Event free survival at 5 and 10 years were 64.2\%
	and 52.6\% respectively and cure fraction was 47.5\% for all cases
	together. Follow up ranged between 0-15 years and survival probabilities
	showed minimal changes after 7 years of follow up. TR and PN emerged
	as independent prognostic factors using Cox and proportional hazard

	stage was considered and it was statistically significant only under
	PH and not under non PH cure models. However, TR and PN continued
	to be independent prognostic factors after adjusting for tumour stage

	with respect to factors of PN and TR was forthcoming across tumour
	stages using PH and non PH cure models, but perceptible differences

	with lower survival. Understanding of the factors that influence
	delay is important for the development of strategies to shorten delays.
	We did a systematic review to assess the quality and strength of
	evidence on risk factors for delays by patients and providers. METHODS:
	We generated hypotheses about the relation between each putative
	risk factor and delay, against which we tested studies. We did searches
	to identify papers containing original data related to risk factors
	for delays by patients (n=86) and providers (n=28). We critically
	appraised the papers for inclusion in the review according to predefined
	criteria. The small number of studies of adequate quality did not
	allow formal meta-analysis. We therefore assigned strength of evidence
	according to a combination of the number and size of studies supporting,
	not supporting, or refuting the hypotheses. FINDINGS: Most studies
	were deemed to be of poor quality and were excluded. Among 23 studies
	of adequate quality, however, there was strong evidence for an association
	between older age and delay by patients, and strong evidence that
	marital status was unrelated to delays by patients. Younger age and
	presentation with a breast symptom other than a lump were strong
	risk factors for delays by providers. Moderate evidence was shown
	for several other factors. INTERPRETATION: The strength of the current
	evidence is inadequate to inform the development of specific strategies
	to shorten delays by patients or providers. Clarification of the
	findings of this review through a major programme of primary research
	is urgently required.},

  abstract = {Because routinely collected survival data for cancer patients in England
	and Wales do not typically specify cause of death, conventional estimates
	of survival in cancer patients based on such data are a measure of
	their mortality from all causes rather than their mortality due to
	cancer. As a result, trends in survival over time are difficult to
	interpret because changes in overall survival may well reflect changes
	in the risk of death from other causes, rather than from the cancer
	of interest. One way of overcoming this problem is to use some form
	of 'relative survival' defined as a measure of survival corrected
	for the effect of other independent causes of death. Since this concept
	was first introduced, various methods for calculating relative survival
	have been proposed and this had led to some confusion as to the most
	appropriate choice of estimate. This paper aims to provide an introduction
	to the concept of relative survival and reviews some of the suggested
	methods of estimation. In addition, a particularly simple, but robust
	approach, is highlighted based on expected and observed mortality.
	This method is illustrated using preliminary data from the Office
	for National Statistics on cancer survival in patients born after
	1939 and diagnosed with cancer during 1972-84. The examples presented,
	although limited to analyses on a small number of selected sites,
	highlight some encouraging trends in survival in people aged under
	35 diagnosed with leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We suggest that surgical extirpation of primary breast
	cancer among other effects accelerates relapse for some premenopausal
	node-positive patients. These accelerated relapses occur within 10
	months of surgery for untreated patients. The mechanism proposed
	is a stimulation of angiogenesis for distant dormant micrometastases.
	This has been suggested as one of the mechanisms to explain the mammography
	paradox for women aged 40-49 years. We could imagine that it also
	plays a role in adjuvant chemotherapy effectiveness since, perhaps
	not coincidentally, this is most beneficial for premenopausal node-positive
	patients. HYPOTHESIS: We speculate that there is a burst of angiogenesis
	of distant dormant micrometastases after surgery in approximately
	20\% of premenopausal node-positive patients. We also speculate that
	this synchronizes them into a temporal highly chemosensitive state
	and is the underlying reason why adjuvant chemotherapy works particularly
	well for that patient category. Furthermore, this may explain why
	cancer in younger patients is more often 'aggressive'. TESTING THE
	HYPOTHESIS: Stimulation of dormant micrometastases by primary tumor
	removal is known to occur in animal models. However, we need to determine
	whether it happens in breast cancer. Transient circulating levels
	of angioactive molecules and serial high-resolution imaging studies
	of focal angiogenesis might help. IMPLICATIONS: Short-course cytotoxic
	chemotherapy after surgery has probably reached its zenith, and other
	strategies, perhaps antiangiogenic methods, are needed to successfully

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent criticisms of the mature breast cancer screening
	trials claimed that there is no evidence that screening saves lives.
	This has developed into a major public controversy, causing physicians,
	women, and policy analysts to rethink and debate mammography-screening
	guidelines. We have studied this subject from a different perspective
	-- using computer simulation to fit a simple growth model to clinical
	data. We can thus provide another viewpoint of the screening controversy
	that may help elucidate the underlying biology and aid policy makers
	in devising sound screening guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: We agree
	with some reviewers that there is partial validity to the criticism.
	Based on our studies, we have arrived at a new explanation of why
	screening has not lived up to expectations. SUMMARY: Our fundamental
	hypothesis is that breast cancers often undergo periods during which
	they are temporarily dormant. In addition, surgical intervention
	to remove primary tumors can interrupt this dormancy. Therefore screening
	finds smaller tumors with fewer positive lymph nodes, which is beneficial.
	But then the resulting extirpation accelerates the growth of dormant
	distant micrometastases, and results in earlier relapses than in
	women who have not been screened. This partly offsets the early detection
	advantage. One hypothetical mechanism proposed to explain this biology
	is that surgical wounding, particularly for premenopausal node-positive
	patients, can trigger the angiogenesis of dormant avascular micrometastases.},

  abstract = {Much attention has been given to determining the benefit of mammographic
	screening to reduce breast cancer mortality. Eight randomized clinical
	trials have been conducted in four countries: the US, Canada, Scotland
	and {S}weden. Trials report an early and stable 30\% reduction in
	breast cancer mortality for women aged 50-59. For women under 50,
	unexpectedly, the early years of screening produce a disadvantage
	to the screened population. Only in later years does an advantage
	appear. To help understand this, we studied relapse patterns using
	a breast cancer database of 1,173 pre- and postmenopausal, node negative
	and positive patients treated with surgery only and having 16-20
	years of follow-up. This approach is relevant since at least five
	of the eight screening trials began before the widespread use of
	adjuvant chemotherapy in the 1980s. Surgical cure rates were independent
	of menopausal status. However, a major difference in early relapse
	rate was found. In premenopausal and node positive patients, 27\%
	of all distant relapses occurred within the first 10 months following
	resection. This is twice the early relapse frequency of any other
	clinical group. Using computer simulation, we interpret that these
	early relapses probably result from a disadvantage induced at surgery.
	A disinhibition or surgery/wounding induced angiogenic surge might
	be responsible. Disinhibition is known to occur in animal models
	such as Lewis lung where lung metastases are avascular and dormant
	until the primary is removed. Sudden outgrowth of tumor after wounding
	has been observed for a century. According to the simulation, in
	breast cancer this induction apparently accelerates inevitable relapses
	by a median of two years. This is offset in later years with a balancing
	reduction in relapses. These data suggest that the angiogenic switch
	may be upregulated more frequently among premenopausal women, perhaps
	depending upon the sex hormones. The acceleration would cause 0.11
	deaths per 1,000 screened aged 40-49 subjects in years 2-3, a value
	comparable to the early year excess mortality in trials of a significant
	0.15 deaths per 1,000 subjects. Equal screening advantage is predicted
	for node negative (but not node positive) pre- and postmenopausal
	patients. The acceleration of relapse after surgery may explain the
	paradoxical effect of mammographic screening for women under 50.},

	surveillance studies, but variation between collecting centres undermines
	its assumption that isolates are independent. We studied the impact
	of this problem and the ability of alternative methods to overcome
	it. We also investigated different study designs and estimated the
	statistical power of the BSAC Resistance Surveillance Programmes.
	METHODS: We simulated datasets with various combinations of study
	design, inter-centre variation, annual centre turnover, initial resistance
	level and odds ratio, and analysed 1000 repetitions of each for trends
	in resistance by five variants of logistic regression. RESULTS: Traditional
	analysis by unadjusted logistic regression was invalid because it
	gave very high type 1 (false-positive) error rates, up to 49\%, in
	the presence of high levels of inter-centre variation and turnover.
	Of the other methods investigated, logistic regression with random
	effects for centre performed best: it had appropriate error rates
	for all study designs assessed and generally had higher power than
	fixed-effects or cluster-robust approaches. A 'Diffuse' study with
	more centres contributing fewer isolates was less susceptible to
	the ill-effects of inter-centre variation than a study of equal overall
	size with fewer centres contributing more, and had slightly higher
	power. CONCLUSIONS: Unadjusted logistic regression, ignoring inter-centre
	variation, is unsuitable for the analysis of trends in typical resistance
	surveillance studies, often leads to erroneous conclusions and should
	be avoided. Random effects logistic regression is an appropriate,
	widely applicable alternative, available in most standard statistical
	software. Collecting isolates from a larger number of centres has
	both statistical and scientific advantages.},

	into the airspaces a 5\% bovine albumin solution with 1.5 microCi
	of 125I-human albumin, 24 h after intratracheal instillation of bacteria.
	The concentration of unlabeled and labeled protein in the distal
	airspaces over 1 h was used as an index of net alveolar fluid clearance.
	Since there was histologic evidence of alveolar epithelial injury,
	several methods were used to measure alveolar fluid clearance, including
	the use of experiments in rats with blood flow and the use of experiments
	in rats without blood flow, so that movement across the epithelial
	barrier would be minimized in the latter group. The results with
	each method were identical. We found that P. aeruginosa pneumonia
	increased alveolar liquid clearance over 1 h by 48\% in studies with
	blood flow, and by 43\% in rats without blood flow, compared with
	respective controls (P < 0.05). In both studies, this increase was
	inhibited with amiloride. However, propranolol had no inhibitory
	effect, thus ruling out a catecholamine-dependent mechanism to explain
	the increase in alveolar fluid clearance. An antitumor necrosis factor-alpha
	neutralizing antibody, instilled into the lung 5 min before bacteria,
	prevented the increase in alveolar liquid clearance in rats with
	pneumonia (P < 0.05). Also, TNFalpha (5 microg) instilled in normal
	rats increased alveolar liquid clearance by 43\% over 1 h compared
	with control rats (P < 0.05). In normal rats instilled with TNFalpha,
	propranolol had no inhibitory effect. In conclusion, gram-negative
	pneumonia markedly upregulates net alveolar epithelial fluid clearance,
	in part by a TNFalpha-dependent mechanism. This finding provides
	a novel mechanism for the upregulation of alveolar epithelial sodium

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: When multiple endpoints are of interest in evidence synthesis,
	a multivariate meta-analysis can jointly synthesise those endpoints
	and utilise their correlation. A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis
	must incorporate and estimate the between-study correlation (rhoB).
	METHODS: In this paper we assess maximum likelihood estimation of
	a general normal model and a generalised model for bivariate random-effects
	meta-analysis (BRMA). We consider two applied examples, one involving
	a diagnostic marker and the other a surrogate outcome. These motivate
	a simulation study where estimation properties from BRMA are compared
	with those from two separate univariate random-effects meta-analyses
	(URMAs), the traditional approach. RESULTS: The normal BRMA model
	estimates rhoB as -1 in both applied examples. Analytically we show
	this is due to the maximum likelihood estimator sensibly truncating
	the between-study covariance matrix on the boundary of its parameter
	space. Our simulations reveal this commonly occurs when the number
	of studies is small or the within-study variation is relatively large;
	it also causes upwardly biased between-study variance estimates,
	which are inflated to compensate for the restriction on rhoB. Importantly,
	this does not induce any systematic bias in the pooled estimates
	and produces conservative standard errors and mean-square errors.
	Furthermore, the normal BRMA is preferable to two normal URMAs; the
	mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates is generally
	smaller in the BRMA, especially given data missing at random. For
	meta-analysis of proportions we then show that a generalised BRMA
	model is better still. This correctly uses a binomial rather than
	normal distribution, and produces better estimates than the normal
	BRMA and also two generalised URMAs; however the model may sometimes
	not converge due to difficulties estimating rhoB. CONCLUSION: A BRMA
	model offers numerous advantages over separate univariate synthesises;
	this paper highlights some of these benefits in both a normal and
	generalised modelling framework, and examines the estimation of between-study
	correlation to aid practitioners.},

  abstract    = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review,
	and where possible meta-analyses, of molecular and biological tumor
	markers described in neuroblastoma, and to establish an evidence-based
	perspective on their clinical value for the screening, diagnosis,
	prognosis, and monitoring of patients. Experimental Design: A well-defined,
	reproducible search strategy was used to identify the relevant literature
	from 1966 to February 2000. RESULTS: A total of 428 papers studying
	the use of 195 different tumor markers in neuroblastoma were identified.
	Small sample sizes, poor statistical reporting, large heterogeneity
	across studies (e.g., in cutoff levels), and publication bias limited
	meta-analysis to the area of prognosis only; MYCN, chromosome 1p,
	DNA index, vanillylmandelic acid:homovanillic acid ratio, CD44, Trk-A,
	neuron-specific enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and multidrug
	resistance were all identified as potentially important prognostic
	tools. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review forms a knowledge base
	of the tumor markers studied thus far in neuroblastoma, and has identified
	some of the most important prognostic markers, which should be considered
	in future research and treatment strategies. Importantly, the review
	has also highlighted some general problems across primary tumor marker
	studies, in particular poor and heterogeneous reporting. These need
	to be addressed to allow better clinical interpretation and enable
	more appropriate evidence-based reviews in the future. In particular,
	collaboration of cancer research groups is needed to enable bigger
	sample sizes, standardize methods of analysis and reporting, and
	facilitate the pooling of individual patient data.},

	for synthesizing evidence across clinical studies. However, for some
	studies IPD may not be available and only aggregate data (AD), such
	as a treatment effect estimate and its standard error, may be obtained.
	In this situation, methods for combining IPD and AD are important
	to utilize all the available evidence. In this paper, we develop
	and assess a range of statistical methods for combining IPD and AD
	in meta-analysis of continuous outcomes from randomized controlled
	trials.The methods take either a one-step or a two-step approach.
	The latter is simple, with IPD reduced to AD so that standard AD
	meta-analysis techniques can be employed. The one-step approach is
	more complex but offers a flexible framework to include both patient-level
	and trial-level parameters. It uses a dummy variable to distinguish
	IPD trials from AD trials and to constrain which parameters the AD
	trials estimate. We show that this is important when assessing how
	patient-level covariates modify treatment effect, as aggregate-level
	relationships across trials are subject to ecological bias and confounding.
	We thus develop models to separate within-trial and across-trials
	treatment-covariate interactions; this ensures that only IPD trials
	estimate the former, whilst both IPD and AD trials estimate the latter
	in addition to the pooled treatment effect and any between-study
	heterogeneity. Extension to multiple correlated outcomes is also
	considered. Ten IPD trials in hypertension, with blood pressure the
	continuous outcome of interest, are used to assess the models and
	identify the benefits of utilizing AD alongside IPD.},

	for synthesizing evidence across several studies. Some studies, however,
	may only provide aggregate data (AD). In this situation researchers
	might need to combine IPD with AD to utilize all the evidence available.
	Here, we review applied IPD meta-analysis articles to assess if and
	how AD is combined with IPD in practice. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:
	A systematic review of articles identified from bibliographic databases
	and searches. RESULTS: We identified 33 applied IPD articles that
	combined IPD and AD and 166 that did not. For each article, we recorded
	the proportion of total studies providing IPD, and found that articles
	combining IPD and AD had, on average, IPD available in only 64\%
	of studies (compared to 90\% in articles not combining IPD and AD).
	Two different methods were used to combine IPD and AD, the two-stage
	method and analysis of partially reconstructed IPD, but a review
	of methodological articles identified two further methods, multilevel
	modeling and Bayesian hierarchical related regression. We summarize
	each method to aid practitioners. CONCLUSION: Combining IPD and AD
	is a relevant issue for evidence synthesis, and the further development
	and validation of suitable meta-analysis methods is needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A major problem for meta-analysis of multiple outcomes
	is the unavailability of some estimates from published and unpublished
	studies. Dissemination bias, in how and what outcomes are reported
	or published, may be causing this incompleteness. This article illustrates
	these problems and presents possible sensitivity analyses to allow
	the most reliable conclusions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a systematic
	review of prognostic marker MYC-N in neuroblastoma, meta-analysis
	for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was of
	interest. Only 17 published studies enabled extraction of both outcome
	estimates, 25 enabled only DFS, 39 enabled only OS, and 70 enabled
	neither outcome. Unidentified unpublished studies may also exist.
	We assessed the robustness of the pooled estimates to the problem
	of missing information. Because OS and DFS estimates seemed to be
	related, we used the known outcome estimates to predict estimates
	known to be missing, and combined this approach with existing methods
	for assessing dissemination bias. RESULTS: The results of the sensitivity
	analyses suggested that the original meta-analysis results were likely
	to be an overestimate of the true OS and DFS effect-sizes but strengthened
	the belief that MYC-N is a potentially important prognostic marker
	in neuroblastoma. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses in meta-analysis
	allow more appropriate and reliable conclusions when problems such

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Borderline ovarian tumors have a favorable prognosis. Previous
	epidemiological studies indicate common risk factors for invasive
	epithelial ovarian cancers and borderline tumors, but it remains
	unresolved whether these tumors are precursors of invasive cancers
	or a separate disease entity. The objective of this population-based
	case-control study conducted in 1993-1995 was to examine reproductive
	and other factors in relation to the risk of borderline ovarian tumors.
	METHODS: Subjects were 193 histologically verified incident epithelial
	borderline tumor cases and 3899 randomly selected controls aged 50-74
	years, whose data were collected through mailed questionnaires. Risk
	estimates were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS:
	Ever parous women were at reduced risk, with odds ratios of 0.44
	(95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.75) for serous and 0.63 (95\%
	CI 0.34-1.19) for mucinous tumors. No clear trends emerged for age
	at first birth, at menarche, and at menopause. Lactation reduced
	tumor risk. Oral contraceptive ever use conferred no protection,
	with odds ratios of 1.40 (95\% CI 0.87-2.26) for serous and 1.04
	(95\% CI 0.61-1.79) for mucinous tumors. The odds ratio for serous
	tumors following unopposed estrogen ever use was 2.07 (95\% CI 1.08-3.95),
	whereas no risk increase appeared with estrogens supplemented by
	cyclic or continuous progestins. Mucinous tumors were not associated
	with hormone replacement therapy. The odds ratio for serous tumors
	in the highest category of body mass index was 6.47 (95\% CI 3.09-13.5).
	CONCLUSIONS: Increasing parity and lactation reduce the risk of borderline
	ovarian tumors in women aged 50-74, while no protection follows oral
	contraceptive use. Hormonal situations such as unopposed estrogen
	use and obesity, where estrogens are not counteracted by progestins,
	may increase the risk of serous tumors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), which is mainly used
	to relieve climacteric symptoms, increases a woman's risk for uterine
	endometrial cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Estrogens
	are often combined with progestins in hormone replacement therapy
	(HRT) to reduce the risk of uterine endometrial cancer. Data on the
	association between HRT including progestins and EOC risk are limited.
	This nationwide case-control study examined EOC risk in relation
	to HRT regimens with sequentially added progestins (HRTsp) and continuously
	added progestins (HRTcp). METHODS: Between 1993 and 1995, we enrolled
	655 histologically verified incident case patients with EOC and 3899
	randomly selected population controls, all 50-74 years of age. Data
	on HRT use were collected through mailed questionnaires. Multivariate-adjusted
	odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
	by the use of unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Risks of
	EOC were elevated among ever users as compared with never users of
	both ERT (OR = 1.43, 95\% CI = 1.02 to 2.00) and HRTsp (OR = 1.54,
	95\% CI = 1.15 to 2.05); risks were elevated for serous, mucinous,
	and endometrioid subtypes. For all EOC types combined, the greatest
	risk increases were seen with hormone use exceeding 10 years. Ever
	use of HRTcp was not associated with increased EOC risk relative
	to HRTcp never use (OR = 1.02, 95\% CI = 0.73 to 1.43). The risk
	of EOC was elevated among HRTsp ever users as compared with HRTcp
	ever users (OR = 1.78, 95\% CI = 1.05 to 3.01). ORs for EOC after
	ever use of low-potency estrogens were 1.18 (95\% CI = 0.89 to 1.55)
	for oral and 1.33 (95\% CI = 1.03 to 1.72) for vaginal applications,
	but no relationship was seen between EOC risk and duration of use.
	CONCLUSION: Ever users of ERT and HRTsp but not HRTcp may be at increased

	effects of both the known proportion of DCOs and the estimated proportion
	of missing cases for each site. In general, adjusting for DCOs led
	to lower survival estimates, whilst adjusting for incompleteness
	had the opposite effect. The Finnish data were largely complete and
	had small proportions of DCOs, and hence the adjustments had little
	effect on estimated survival. The changes in the Thames estimates
	were more marked. When performing cohort survival analysis (based
	on diagnoses between 1990 and 1994), the increases in the survival
	estimates gained from adjusting for incompleteness were for the most
	part offset by the decrease produced when adjusting for DCOs. However,
	when performing period survival analysis based on the period 1997-2001
	(when the DCO rate at Thames had fallen by around a half relative
	to the earlier period), the final estimates (adjusted for both effects)
	were generally higher than the unadjusted values--thus reducing the

	seven cancer sites (2,51,316 cases) collected by FRANCIM cancer registries.
	Net survivals were estimated at 5, 10 and 15 years postdiagnosis.
	At 5 years, the errors were generally small. At 10 years, in good-prognosis
	cancers, the errors made in nonstandardized estimates with all classical

	N and Cancho VG. Destructive weighted Poisson cure rate models. Technical
	Report, Universidade Federal de S{\AA}£o Carlos, S{\AA}£o Carlos-SP. Brazil,

	accumulated number of lesions or altered cells follows a compound
	weighted Poisson distribution. This model is more flexible than the
	promotion time cure model in terms of dispersion. Moreover, it possesses
	an interesting and realistic interpretation of the biological mechanism
	of the occurrence of the event of interest as it includes a destructive
	process of tumour cells after an initial treatment or the capacity
	of an individual exposed to irradiation to repair altered cells that
	results in cancer induction. In other words, what is recorded is
	only the damaged portion of the original number of altered cells
	not eliminated by the treatment or repaired by the repair system
	of an individual. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are then
	used to develop Bayesian inference for the proposed model. Also,

  abstract = {In a meta-analysis combining survival data from different clinical
	trials, an important issue is the possible heterogeneity between
	trials. Such intertrial variation can not only be explained by heterogeneity
	of treatment effects across trials but also by heterogeneity of their
	baseline risk. In addition, one might examine the relationship between
	magnitude of the treatment effect and the underlying risk of the
	patients in the different trials. Such a scenario can be accounted
	for by using additive random effects in the Cox model, with a random
	trial effect and a random treatment-by-trial interaction. We propose
	to use this kind of model with a general correlation structure for
	the random effects and to estimate parameters and hazard function
	using a semi-parametric penalized marginal likelihood method (maximum
	penalized likelihood estimators). This approach gives smoothed estimates
	of the hazard function, which represents incidence in epidemiology.
	The idea for the approach in this paper comes from the study of heterogeneity
	in a large meta-analysis of randomized trials in patients with head
	and neck cancers (meta-analysis of chemotherapy in head and neck
	cancers) and the effect of adding chemotherapy to locoregional treatment.
	The simulation study and the application demonstrate that the proposed
	approach yields satisfactory results and they illustrate the need
	to use a flexible variance-covariance structure for the random effects.},

	factors in Irish ALS patients. Cox regression has become the default
	tool for survival analysis, but recently new classes of flexible
	parametric survival analysis tools known as Royston-Parmar models
	have become available.We employed Cox proportional hazards and Royston-Parmar
	flexible parametric modeling to examine factors affecting survival
	in Irish ALS patients. We further examined the effect of choice of
	timescale on Cox models and the proportional hazards assumption,
	and extended both Cox and Royston-Parmar models with time varying
	components.On comparison of models we chose a Royston-Parmar proportional
	hazards model without time varying covariates as the best fit. Using
	this model we confirmed the association of known survival markers
	in ALS including age at diagnosis (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.34 per 10
	year increase; 95\% CI 1.26-1.42), diagnostic delay (HR 0.96 per
	12 weeks delay; 95\% CI 0.94-0.97), Definite ALS (HR 1.47 95\% CI

	of Cox proportional hazard and Royston-Parmar flexible parametric
	methods. By including time varying components we were able to gain
	deeper understanding of the dataset. Variation in survival between
	time periods appears to be due to missing data in the first time
	period. The use of age as timescale to account for confounding by
	age resolved breaches of the proportional hazards assumption, but
	in doing so may have obscured deficiencies in the data. Our study
	demonstrates the need to test for, and fully explore, breaches of
	the Cox proportional hazards assumption. Royston-Parmar flexible

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancers of different histology have different
	clinical and prognostic features. There are also indications of differences
	in aetiology. We therefore evaluated the risk of the three most common
	histological subtypes in relation to menopausal hormone therapy and
	other breast cancer risk factors. METHODS: We used a population-based
	case-control study of breast cancer to evaluate menopausal hormone
	therapy and other breast cancer risk factors for risk by histological
	subtype. Women aged 50 to 74 years, diagnosed with invasive ductal
	(n = 1,888), lobular (n = 308) or tubular (n = 93) breast cancer
	in {S}weden in 1993 to 1995 were compared with 3,065 age-frequency
	matched controls randomly selected from the population. Unconditional
	logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95\%
	confidence intervals (CIs) for ductal, lobular, and tubular cancer.
	RESULTS: Women who had used medium potency estrogen alone were at
	increased risks of both ductal and lobular cancer. Medium potency
	estrogen-progestin was associated with increased risks for all subtypes,
	but the estimates for lobular and tubular cancer were higher compared
	with ductal cancer. We found OR 5.6 (95\% CI 3.2-9.7) for lobular
	cancer, OR 6.5 (95\% CI 2.8-14.9) for tubular cancer and OR 2.3 (95\%
	CI 1.6-3.3) for ductal cancer with > or =5 years use of medium potency
	estrogen-progestin therapy. Low potency oral estrogen (mainly estriol)
	appeared to be associated with an increased risk for lobular cancer,
	but the association was strongest for short-term use. Reproductive
	and anthropometric factors, smoking, and past use of oral contraceptives
	were mostly similarly related to the risks of the three breast cancer
	subtypes. Recent alcohol consumption of > 10 g alcohol/day was associated
	with increased risk only for tubular cancer (OR 3.1, 95\% CI 1.4-6.8).
	CONCLUSION: Menopausal hormone therapy was associated with increased
	risks for breast cancer of both ductal and lobular subtype, and medium
	potency estrogen-progestin therapy was more strongly associated with
	lobular compared with ductal cancer. We also found medium potency
	estrogen-progestin therapy and alcohol to be strongly associated
	with tubular cancer. With some exceptions, most other risk factors
	seemed to be similarly associated with the three subtypes of breast
	cancer.},

  abstract = {Breast radiotherapy as practised in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in

	result in greater cardiovascular mortality following irradiation
	of the left breast when compared with the right.All cases of female
	breast cancer diagnosed between 1971 and 1988 and recorded on the
	Thames Cancer Registry database were followed up to the end of 2003
	to identify cases who had died from ischaemic heart disease (IHD)
	or any cardiovascular disease (CVD). A proportional hazards regression
	analysis was performed, stratified by time since diagnosis, using
	as the baseline group those women with right-sided disease who did
	not receive radiotherapy, and adjusting for age at diagnosis.A total
	of 20,871 women with breast cancer were included in the analysis,
	of which 51\% had left-sided disease. Mortality at 15+ years after

	METHODS: We propose an approach based on transformation and fractional
	polynomials which yields simple regression models with interpretable
	curves. We suggest a way of presenting the results from such models
	which involves tabulating the risks estimated from the model at convenient
	values of the risk factor. We discuss how to incorporate several
	continuous risk and confounding variables within a single model.
	The approach is exemplified with data from the Whitehall I study
	of British Civil Servants. We discuss the approach in relation to
	categorization and non-parametric regression models. RESULTS: We

  abstract = {Most randomized controlled trials with a time-to-event outcome are
	designed assuming proportional hazards (PH) of the treatment effect.
	The sample size calculation is based on a logrank test. However,
	non-proportional hazards are increasingly common. At analysis, the
	estimated hazards ratio with a confidence interval is usually presented.
	The estimate is often obtained from a Cox PH model with treatment
	as a covariate. If non-proportional hazards are present, the logrank
	and equivalent Cox tests may lose power. To safeguard power, we previously
	suggested a 'joint test' combining the Cox test with a test of non-proportional
	hazards. Unfortunately, a larger sample size is needed to preserve
	power under PH. Here, we describe a novel test that unites the Cox
	test with a permutation test based on restricted mean survival time.
	We propose a combined hypothesis test based on a permutation test
	of the difference in restricted mean survival time across time. The
	test involves the minimum of the Cox and permutation test P-values.
	We approximate its null distribution and correct it for correlation
	between the two P-values. Using extensive simulations, we assess
	the type 1 error and power of the combined test under several scenarios
	and compare with other tests. We investigate powering a trial using
	the combined test. The type 1 error of the combined test is close
	to nominal. Power under proportional hazards is slightly lower than
	for the Cox test. Enhanced power is available when the treatment
	difference shows an 'early effect', an initial separation of survival
	curves which diminishes over time. The power is reduced under a 'late
	effect', when little or no difference in survival curves is seen
	for an initial period and then a late separation occurs. We propose
	a method of powering a trial using the combined test. The 'insurance
	premium' offered by the combined test to safeguard power under non-PH
	represents about a single-digit percentage increase in sample size.
	The combined test increases trial power under an early treatment
	effect and protects power under other scenarios. Use of restricted
	mean survival time facilitates testing and displaying a generalized
	treatment effect.},

	almost invariably rely on the hazard ratio to estimate the treatment
	effect and implicitly, therefore, on the proportional hazards assumption.
	However, the results of some recent trials indicate that there is
	no guarantee that the assumption will hold. Here, we describe the
	use of the restricted mean survival time as a possible alternative
	tool in the design and analysis of these trials. The restricted mean
	is a measure of average survival from time 0 to a specified time
	point, and may be estimated as the area under the survival curve
	up to that point. We consider the design of such trials according
	to a wide range of possible survival distributions in the control
	and research arm(s). The distributions are conveniently defined as
	piecewise exponential distributions and can be specified through
	piecewise constant hazards and time-fixed or time-dependent hazard
	ratios. Such designs can embody proportional or non-proportional
	hazards of the treatment effect. We demonstrate the use of restricted
	mean survival time and a test of the difference in restricted means
	as an alternative measure of treatment effect. We support the approach
	through the results of simulation studies and in real examples from
	several cancer trials. We illustrate the required sample size under
	proportional and non-proportional hazards, also the significance
	level and power of the proposed test. Values are compared with those
	from the standard approach which utilizes the logrank test. We conclude
	that the hazard ratio cannot be recommended as a general measure
	of the treatment effect in a randomized controlled trial, nor is
	it always appropriate when designing a trial. Restricted mean survival
	time may provide a practical way forward and deserves greater attention.},

	effectiveness of a new treatment compared with a standard-of-care

	ratio is valid only under the proportional hazards (PH) assumption.
	This assumption is formally checked only rarely. Some recent trials,
	particularly the IPASS trial in lung cancer and the ICON7 trial in
	ovarian cancer, have alerted researchers to the possibility of gross
	non-PH, raising the critical question of how such data should be

	to report the difference between two survival curves. We describe

	is often required to make reporting simpler. This can be obtained
	by pooling all ages or, more commonly, by using age-standardisation.
	The various methods for providing a single figure estimate of relative
	survival can give very different estimates.The problem is illustrated
	through an example using Finnish thyroid cancer data. The differences
	are further explored through a simulation study that investigates
	the effect of age on the estimates of relative survival.The example
	highlights that in practice the all-age estimates from the various
	methods can be substantially different (up to 6 percentage units
	at 15 years of follow-up). The simulation study confirms the finding
	that differing estimates for the all-age estimates of relative survival
	are obtained. Performing age-standardisation makes the methods more
	comparable and results in better estimation of the true net survival.The
	all-age estimates of relative survival rarely give an appropriate
	estimate of net survival. We feel that modelling or stratifying by
	age when calculating relative survival is vitally important as the
	lack of homogeneity in the cohort of patients leads to potentially
	biased estimates. We feel that the methods using modelling provide
	a greater flexibility than life-table based approaches. The flexible

  abstract    = {Background:When making international comparisons of cancer survival,
	it is essential reported differences are real effects and not an
	artefact of potential errors in cancer registration.Methods:We use
	simulation methods to assess the impact of various cancer registration
	errors on commonly reported outcomes of cancer survival (1-, and
	5-year relative survival estimates). We draw two samples of patients
	diagnosed with cancer from one population and introduce potential
	registration errors in one of the sample populations under various
	assumptions. We investigate the effect of errors individually as
	well as the composite effect when combined with other registration
	errors.Results:The results indicate that high levels of cancer registration
	errors are necessary to make a noticeable effect on commonly reported
	metrics of cancer survival. Differences of up to 3 percentage units
	in the 5-year relative survival proportion are seen under plausible
	scenarios.Conclusion:This study is a comprehensive assessment of
	cancer registration errors and the consequent impact on commonly
	reported survival statistics. We show that under plausible scenarios,
	it is very unlikely that these biases are large enough to explain
	the variation in international comparisons of cancer survival. Registration
	errors will also impact on other metrics reported from registry data,
	such as incidence.},

	via a comparison with existing methods in the setting of Finnish

	newly proposed method are twofold. Firstly, improvements are seen

	Patients with left-sided tumours were found to have a higher mortality

	modified and previously unrecognized ancient lineage of angiosperms.
	Molecular phylogenetic analyses of multiple plastid genes and associated

	36 (14\%) treated infants, but in none of the controls (P = 0.03).
	The dose of furosemide was higher in the infants with nephrocalcinosis

	0.01). The urinary calcium concentration was higher in the infants

	were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
	chain reaction and proteins by Western blotting. One day after infarction,
	MI rats had 4.3 times (P < 0.001) higher pineal melatonin synthesis,
	than sham-operated animals, which was associated with the increased
	concentration of melatonin in plasma (P < 0.001) and left ventricle
	(LV) (P = 0.01). The amount of MT(1) receptor protein decreased significantly
	in MI LVs compared with control LVs 1 day after infarction (P < 0.01),
	followed by recovery during the next 2 wk. Furthermore, the expression
	of MT(1) receptor mRNA of the MI LVs was elevated 2 wk after infarction
	(P < 0.01) compared with control LVs. The amount of MT(2) receptor
	proteins in MI LVs was higher than in sham-operated LVs 1 day (P
	< 0.05) and 4 wk (P < 0.01) after MI. In conclusion, melatonin synthesis
	in the pineal gland increased rapidly in response to the MI, supporting
	an important role for endogenous melatonin in protecting the heart
	after MI. The observed changes in the expression of MT(1) and MT(2)
	receptors suggest that melatonin receptors may be involved in mediating,
	at least, in part, the protective effects of melatonin in the heart

	Methods: Age-sex-tumour specific five-year relative survival ratios
	were calculated for cancer patients diagnosed with 27 tumour sites
	(representing about 92\% of all cancers) in 2006-10. These were used
	to estimate the number of M?ori, non-M?ori and total deaths (and
	proportion of excess deaths) that would have been avoidable within
	five years of diagnosis had New Zealand's relative survival been
	equivalent to Australia's. Results: A total of 3,631 cancer deaths
	(726/year; 13.4\% of excess deaths) could have been avoidable. Among
	25 tumours where ethnic-specific results were estimated, there were
	851 potentially avoidable deaths in M?ori (24.9\%) and 2,758 in non-M?ori
	(11.8\%). Breast, bowel, lung and prostate tumours made up 64\% of
	avoidable deaths. Those with the highest proportions of avoidable
	deaths were thyroid (44.7\%), prostate (35.5\%), breast (30.0\%)
	and uterus (23.5\%). More than 50\% of M?ori melanoma, prostate,
	testis and thyroid cancer deaths were avoidable. Conclusion: A significant
	number of cancer deaths could be avoidable if New Zealand achieved
	Australia's relative survival ratios. The proportion is much higher
	for M?ori than for non-M?ori. Implications: There is considerable
	scope to improve cancer outcomes in New Zealand.},

	case series from the Surveillance, Epidemiogy, and End Results (SEER)
	program (13,172 women) and the European Concerted Action on survival
	and Care of Cancer Patients (EUROCARE) project (4478 women). RESULTS:
	Early-stage tumors (T1N0M0) were more frequent in the SEER data (41\%
	of cases) than in the EUROCARE data (29\%). In the SEER data, early
	tumors were more frequent in women age > or = 65 years (43\%) than
	in younger women (38\%), whereas the reverse was true in the European
	data (25\% vs. 31\%). In both case series, > 90\% of women underwent
	surgery and 81-82\% underwent lymphadenectomy, but the number of
	axillary lymph nodes evaluated was higher in the SEER data than in
	the EUROCARE data. The 5-year survival rate was higher in the U.S.
	case series (89\%) than in the European series (79\%). This differential
	was observed for each stage category evaluated: early (T1N0M0), large
	lymph node-negative (T2-3N0M0), lymph node-positive (T1-3N+M0), locally
	advanced (T4M0), and metastatic (M1) tumors. The overall relative
	excess risk (RER) of death was significantly higher (RER, 1.37; 95\%
	confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.25-1.50) among European women compared
	with U.S. women (referent group). Adjustment for stage, age, surgery,
	and the number of lymph nodes evaluated explained most of the excess
	risk (RER, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.17). CONCLUSIONS: Transatlantic
	differences in the 5-year survival rates for women diagnosed with
	breast carcinoma between 1990 and 1992 were attributable mainly to
	differences in stage of disease. Resources should be invested to
	achieve earlier diagnosis of breast carcinoma in Europe, especially

	countries (Estonia, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and UK) that
	were combined into 9 regional groups based on similar survival. Five-year
	relative survival was 79\% overall, varying from 98\% for early,

	tumours; 76\% for node-positive (T1-3N+M0) tumours and 55\% for locally
	advanced (T4NxM0) tumours to 18\% for metastatic (M1) tumours and
	69\% for tumours of unspecified stage. There was considerable variation
	across Europe in relative survival within each disease stage, but

	After adjusting for TNM stage and the number of nodes examined, survival
	differences were greatly reduced, indicating that for these women,
	diagnosed with breast cancer in Europe during 1990-1992, the survival
	differences were mainly due to differences in stage at diagnosis.
	However, in 3 regional groups, the relative risks of death remained
	high even after these adjustments, suggesting less than optimal treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two main methods of quantifying cancer patient survival
	are generally used: cancer-specific survival and relative survival.
	Both techniques are used to estimate survival in a single population,
	or to estimate differences in survival between populations. Arguments
	have been made that the relative survival approach is the only valid
	choice for population-based cancer survival studies because cancer-specific
	survival estimates may be invalid if there is misclassification of
	the cause of death. However, there has been little discussion, or
	evidence, as to how strong such biases may be, or of the potential
	biases that may result using relative survival techniques, particularly
	bias arising from the requirement for an external comparison group.
	METHODS: In this article we investigate the assumptions underlying
	both methods of survival analysis. We provide simulations relating
	to the impact of misclassification of death and non-comparability
	of expected survival for cause-specific and relative survival approaches,
	respectively. RESULTS: For cause-specific analyses, bias through
	misclassification of cause of death resulted in error in descriptive
	analyses particularly of cancers with moderate or poor survival,
	but had smaller impact in analyses involving group comparisons. Relative
	survival ratio (RSR) estimations were robust in relation to non-comparability
	of comparison populations for single RSR but were less so in group
	comparisons where there was large variation in survival. CONCLUSIONS:
	Both cause-specific survival and relative survival are potentially
	valid epidemiological methods in population-based cancer survival
	studies, and the choice of method is dependent on the likely magnitude
	and direction of the biases in the specific analyses to be conducted.},

	In most clinical studies, estimating the cumulative incidence function
	(or the probability of experiencing an event by a given time) is
	of primary interest. When the data consist of patients who experience
	an event and censored individuals, a nonparametric estimate of the
	cumulative incidence can be obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.
	Under this approach, the censoring mechanism is assumed to be noninformative.
	In other words, the survival time of an individual (or the time at
	which a subject experiences an event) is assumed to be independent
	of a mechanism that would cause the patient to be censored. Often
	times, a patient may experience an event other than the one of interest
	which alters the probability of experiencing the event of interest.
	Such events are known as competing risk events. In this setting,
	it would often be of interest to calculate the cumulative incidence
	of a specific event of interest. Any subject who does not experience
	the event of interest can be treated as censored. However, a patient
	experiencing a competing risk event is censored in an informative
	manner. Hence, the Kaplan-Meier estimation procedure may not be directly
	applicable. The cumulative incidence function for an event of interest
	must be calculated by appropriately accounting for the presence of
	competing risk events. In this paper, we illustrate nonparametric
	estimation of the cumulative incidence function for an event of interest
	in the presence of competing risk events using two published data
	sets. We compare the resulting estimates with those obtained using
	the Kaplan-Meier approach to demonstrate the importance of appropriately
	estimating the cumulative incidence of an event of interest in the
	presence of competing risk events.},

	to derive theoretically unbiased estimators and examine which of
	the two data settings was the most robust against incorrect assumptions

	diagnosed with breast cancer between 1981 and 1991, and estimated
	net survival up to 20-years using both cause-specific and relative
	survival settings, by tackling the informative censoring with weights.
	To understand the possible origins of differences between the survival
	estimates, we performed sensitivity analyses within each setting.
	We evaluated the impact of misclassification of cause of death and
	of using inappropriate life tables on survival estimates.Net survival
	was highest using the cause-specific setting, by 1\% at one year
	and by up to around 11\% twenty years after diagnosis. Differences
	between both sets of net survival estimates were eliminated after
	recoding between 15\% and 20\% of the non-specific deaths as breast
	cancer deaths. By contrast, a dramatic increase in the general population
	mortality rates was needed to see the survival estimates based on
	relative survival setting become closer to those derived from cause-specific
	setting.Net survival estimates derived using the cause-specific setting
	are very sensitive to misclassification of cause of death. Net survival
	estimates derived using the relative-survival setting were robust
	to large changes in expected mortality. The relative survival setting
	is recommended for estimation of long-term net survival among patients

  abstract = {Often the effect of at least one of the prognostic factors in a Cox
	regression model changes over time, which violates the proportional
	hazards assumption of this model. As a consequence, the average hazard
	ratio for such a prognostic factor is under- or overestimated. While
	there are several methods to appropriately cope with non-proportional
	hazards, in particular by including parameters for time-dependent
	effects, weighted estimation in Cox regression is a parsimonious
	alternative without additional parameters. The methodology, which
	extends the weighted k-sample logrank tests of the Tarone-Ware scheme
	to models with multiple, binary and continuous covariates, has been
	introduced in the nineties of the last century and is further developed
	and re-evaluated in this contribution. The notion of an average hazard
	ratio is defined and its connection to the effect size measure P(X<Y)
	is emphasized. The suggested approach accomplishes estimation of
	intuitively interpretable average hazard ratios and provides tools
	for inference. A Monte Carlo study confirms the satisfactory performance.
	Advantages of the approach are exemplified by comparing standard
	and weighted analyses of an international lung cancer study. SAS
	and R programs facilitate application.},

  abstract = {Complex clinical endpoints are present in studies in cancer. Especially
	in studies on hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), various

	graft versus host disease (GVHD) or need to undergo immunosuppressive
	therapy (IST), a relapse can occur, or patients can die after relapse
	or without former relapse (nonrelapse mortality, NRM). Sometimes,
	endpoints can be reasonably combined in a composite endpoint, as,
	for example, relapse and NRM are combined into disease-free survival
	(DFS). In this case, standard survival techniques, as Kaplan-Meier
	estimation of the DFS probability, can be applied. Often, interest
	focuses on endpoints for which competing risks are present, as, for
	example, GVHD, with death without prior GVHD as competing risk. This
	results in a competing risks model, a special case of a multistate
	model. A more complex multistate model is required when the effects
	of events occurring in the course of the study on further disease
	process shall be investigated, as, for example, the effect of GVHD
	on relapse and NRM. Another endpoint of interest is time under IST.
	As patients usually experience multiple episodes of IST, thus switching
	back and forth between "IST" and "no IST" during follow-up, the multistate
	model used for analysis must be adapted for this event structure.

	of Cox-type regression models suitable for the different situations

	HER2 is implicated in disease initiation and progression, associated
	with poor prognosis, and may also predict the response to chemotherapy
	and hormonal therapy. Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have
	been designed to specifically antagonize the function of the HER2
	receptor in HER2-positive tumors. Clinical phase II and III trials
	have demonstrated the efficacy of the humanized anti-HER2 MAb, trastuzumab
	(Herceptin), both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy
	in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the
	prevalence of HER2 overexpression/amplification in various tumor
	types raises the possibility of using anti-HER2 MAbs to antagonize
	the abnormal function of overexpressed HER2 receptors in HER2-positive
	tumors other than breast. Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that
	anti-HER2 MAbs suppress the proliferation of ovarian, gastric and
	NSCLC cell lines that overexpress the HER2 receptor. These results
	indicate that anti-HER2 MAbs may have important therapeutic significance
	in patients presenting with these or other human carcinomas. Clinical

	that patients experience compared with their relevant reference population.
	Based on follow-up data from the Finnish Cancer Registry, we derived

	often superior to those of the other estimators at 10 and 15ÃÂÃÂ years,

	(2012 [4]) and recommended to substitute the relative survival methods
	in current use for evaluating population-based cancer survival.The
	new method is based on the use of continuous follow-up time, and
	is unbiased only under non-informative censoring of the observed
	survival. However, the population-based cancer survival is often
	evaluated based on annually or monthly tabulated follow-up intervals.
	An empirical investigation based on data from the Finnish Cancer
	Registry was made into the practical importance of the censoring
	and the level of data tabulation. A systematic comparison was made
	against the earlier recommended Ederer II method of relative survival
	using the two currently available computer programs (Pohar Perme
	(2013) [10] and Dickman et al. (2013) [11]).With exact or monthly
	tabulated data, the Pohar-Perme and the Ederer II methods give, on
	average, results that are at five years of follow-up less than 0.5\%
	units and at 10 and 14years 1-2\% units apart from each other. The
	Pohar-Perme net survival estimator is prone to random variation and
	may result in biased estimates when exact follow-up times are not
	available or follow-up is incomplete. With annually tabulated follow-up
	times, estimates can deviate substantially from those based on more
	accurate observations, if the actuarial approach is not used.At 5years,
	both the methods perform well. In longer follow-up, the Pohar-Perme
	estimates should be interpreted with caution using error margins.
	The actuarial approach should be preferred, if data are annually

	with random effects to cause-specific survival data of female breast
	cancer patients collected by the population-based Finnish Cancer

	variation in the cure fraction and in the survival of the non-cured
	patients, respectively. This hierarchical model was implemented in
	a Bayesian framework using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm. To
	avoid poor mixing of the Markov chain, when the variance of either
	set of random effects was close to zero, posterior simulations were
	based on a parameter-expanded model with tailor-made proposal distributions
	in Metropolis steps. The random effects allowed the fitting of the
	cure fraction model to the sparse regional data and the estimation
	of the regional variation in 10-year cause-specific breast cancer
	survival with a parsimonious number of parameters. Before 1986, the

	functions (CIFs) commonly used for competing risks data. The model
	adopts a modified logistic model as the baseline CIF and a generalized
	odds-rate model for covariate effects, and it explicitly takes into
	account the constraint that a subject with any given prognostic factors
	should eventually fail from one of the causes such that the asymptotes
	of the CIFs should add up to one. This constraint intrinsically holds
	in a nonparametric analysis without covariates, but is easily overlooked
	in a semiparametric or parametric regression setting. We hence model
	the CIF from the primary cause assuming the generalized odds-rate
	transformation and the modified logistic function as the baseline
	CIF. Under the additivity constraint, the covariate effects on the
	competing cause are modeled by a function of the asymptote of the
	baseline distribution and the covariate effects on the primary cause.
	The inference procedure is straightforward by using the standard
	maximum likelihood theory. We demonstrate desirable finite-sample
	performance of our model by simulation studies in comparison with
	existing methods. Its practical utility is illustrated in an analysis
	of a breast cancer dataset to assess the treatment effect of tamoxifen,
	adjusting for age and initial pathological tumor size, on breast
	cancer recurrence that is subject to dependent censoring by second
	primary cancers and deaths.},

	Meta-regression can be used to estimate such interactions using published

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses based on individual patient data (IPD) are
	regarded as the gold standard for systematic reviews. However, the
	methods used for analysing and presenting results from IPD meta-analyses
	have received little discussion. METHODS: We review 44 IPD meta-analyses
	published during the years 1999-2001. We summarize whether they obtained
	all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the
	analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and
	how they examined the effects of covariates. RESULTS: Twenty-four
	out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses
	(28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined
	the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three
	analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they
	came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects
	methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated
	by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data
	from less than 80\% of the randomized patients sought, but did not
	address the resulting potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Although IPD
	meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health
	care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to
	make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects.
	In particular, IPD could be used to more fully investigate the influence
	of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within
	and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random
	effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for
	enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of IPD meta-analysis.},

	study, we looked for trends in relative survival for all patients
	diagnosed with HL in Sweden from 1973-2009 (N = 6949; 3985 men and
	2964 women; median age, 45 years) and followed up for death until
	the end of 2010. Patients were categorized into 6 age groups and
	5 calendar periods (1973-1979, 1980-1986, 1987-1994, 1994-2000, and
	2001-2009). Relative survival improved in all age groups, with the
	greatest improvement in patients 51-65 years of age (P < .0005).
	A plateau in relative survival was observed in patients below 65
	years of age during the last calendar period, suggesting a reduced
	long-term, treatment-related mortality. The 10-year relative survival
	for patients diagnosed in 2000-2009 was 0.95, 0.96, 0.93, 0.80, and
	0.44 for the age groups 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51-65, and 66-80, respectively.
	Therefore, despite progress, age at diagnosis remains an important
	prognostic factor (P < .0005). Advances in therapy for patients with
	limited and advanced-stage HL have contributed to an increasing cure
	rate. In addition, our findings support that long-term mortality
	of HL therapy has decreased. Elderly HL patients still do poorly,
	and targeted treatment options associated with fewer side effects
	will advance the clinical HL field.},

	period 1996-2005, and followed them up until the end of 2010. CSS
	estimates were calculated (i) considering cause of death to be the
	cancer that was originally diagnosed and (ii) considering the cause
	of death to be a cancer within the same organ system. For most cancer
	sites the difference between CSS and RS estimates was small (<5\%).
	The greatest differences were seen for rarer cancers such as mediastinum
	and Kaposi sarcoma. Including deaths from the same organ system in
	the calculation of CSS further reduced the differences for many sites.
	For younger age groups and shorter time since diagnosis, RS and CSS
	estimates tended to be similar, whereas CSS estimates tended to be
	lower than RS estimates with longer time since diagnosis in the oldest
	age groups. When compared to RS estimates CSS estimates were reliable

	of long-term survival. Period analysis, based on life-table methodology,
	provides more up-to-date survival estimates by exploring survival
	during a restricted recent period of interest. It excludes the short-term
	survival of patients recruited at the start of the study. We use
	statistical models to further develop the method of period analysis,
	providing more up-to-date estimates of survival and the ability to
	explore differences in survival by covariates and adjust for case
	mix. METHODS: We use cancer registry data for colorectal cancer in
	Leicestershire, UK, to illustrate the use of Cox proportional hazards
	(CPH) models to estimate period and standard survival. We compare
	these estimates with those obtained using life-table methodology.
	RESULTS: Period estimates were slightly higher than the standard
	estimates as they reflect recent improvements in short-term survival.
	The results for period analysis using the life-table approach and
	using CPH models were similar. However, CPH models allowed further
	investigation of other risk factors and the ability to control for
	potential confounding variables. CONCLUSION: Using period survival
	estimates, more up-to-date information is available to clinicians
	and others with an interest in monitoring survival. Period CHP models
	offer all the advantages of statistical modeling, and are straightforward
	to fit in standard statistical packages.},

	other-cause mortality rates that raised it by 0.23 years. Other common

	We compared the relative association with survival after ST-elevation

	study in 4702 consecutive patients with ST elevation AMI (STEMI)
	occurring April 1st 1993 - December 31st 2005, assessed for mortality
	at 30 days and 1 year. Patients were classified according to antecedent

	1, <7mmol/L; quartile 2, 7 - 8.2 mmol/L; quartile 3, 8.3 - 10.9 mmol/L;
	quartile 4, >/=11 mmol/L). Multivariable models were constructed
	for determinants of mortality, including year of STEMI and demographic
	variables, entering blood glucose concentration and antecedent diabetes
	individually, and together. All-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality
	were 22.8\% and 31.3\% for patients with antecedent diabetes, compared
	to 16.3\% and 23.0\% respectively for those without. For glucose
	quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, crude 30-day mortality was 9.0\%, 10.6\%,
	17.9\% and 31.0\%. Adjusted 30-day mortality risk was similar in
	quartile 2, higher by >80\% in quartile 3 and by >150\% in quartile
	4, compared to glucose quartile 1. Antecedent diabetes was associated
	with an increase in mortality (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.52 (95\%
	CI 1.24 , 1.86)). On multivariable analysis (excluding glucose quartile),
	this reduced to 1.24 (0.98 , 1.58) and changed to a small, statistically
	non-significant reduction in risk when glucose quartile was added
	to the analysis (adjusted OR 0.87 (0.67 , 1.13)). Inclusion of antecedent
	diabetes in multivariable models did not add to the predictive value
	for mortality of glucose quartile (p=0.368). Similar relationships
	were observed for 1 year mortality. In patients with STEMI, blood
	glucose concentration shows graded association with risk of 30-day
	and 1-year mortality and is of greater prognostic relevance than
	antecedent diabetes diagnosis. Moderate elevation of blood glucose,
	below levels previously considered to be clinically relevant, is

	people aged 60 years or older. In 1989, the European Working Party
	on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly investigated whether active
	treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic
	hypertension. Fatal and non-fatal stroke combined was the primary
	endpoint. METHODS: All patients (> 60 years) were initially started
	on masked placebo. At three run-in visits 1 month apart, their average
	sitting systolic blood pressure was 160-219 mm Hg with a diastolic
	blood pressure lower than 95 mm Hg. After stratification for centre,
	sex, and previous cardiovascular complications, 4695 patients were
	randomly assigned to nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible
	addition of enalapril 5-20 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-25.0
	mg daily, or matching placebos. Patients withdrawing from double-blind
	treatment were still followed up. We compared occurrence of major
	endpoints by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At a median of 2 years'
	follow-up, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures had fallen
	by 13 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg in the placebo group (n = 2297) and by 23
	mm Hg and 7 mm Hg in the active treatment group (n = 2398). The between-group
	differences were systolic 10.1 mm Hg (95\% CI 8.8-11.4) and diastolic,
	4.5 mm Hg (3.9-5.1). Active treatment reduced the total rate of stroke
	from 13.7 to 7.9 endpoints per 1000 patient-years (42\% reduction;
	p = 0.003). Non-fatal stroke decreased by 44\% (p = 0.007). In the
	active treatment group, all fatal and non-fatal cardiac endpoints,
	including sudden death, declined by 26\% (p = 0.03). Non-fatal cardiac
	endpoints decreased by 33\% (p = 0.03) and all fatal and non-fatal
	cardiovascular endpoints by 31\% (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality
	was slightly lower on active treatment (-27\%, p = 0.07), but all-cause
	mortality was not influenced (-14\%; p = 0.22). INTERPRETATION: Among
	elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive
	drug treatment starting with nitrendipine reduces the rate of cardiovascular
	complications. Treatment of 1000 patients for 5 years with this type
	of regimen may prevent 29 strokes or 53 major cardiovascular endpoints.},

	characteristics, differences in lifestyle, or attendance at antenatal
	care. METHODS: Population-based individually-matched case-control
	study including 702 cases of stillbirth and 702 controls among Swedish
	primiparous women giving birth 1987-1996. We estimated the risk of
	stillbirth, and subgroups of stillbirth, for various categories of
	SES. Odds ratios (OR) with 95\% CI, estimated by conditional logistic
	regression, were used to approximate the relative risk. The estimates
	were adjusted for maternal age, height, body mass index, cigarette
	smoking, and when necessary mother's country of birth. RESULTS: Compared
	with women who were high level white-collar workers, the adjusted
	risks of stillbirth were as follows: unskilled blue-collar workers,
	2.2 (95\% CI : 1.3- 3.7), skilled blue-collar workers, 2.4 (95\%

	and intermediate level white-collar workers 1.4 (95\% CI : 0.9-2.4).
	These risks were not substantially changed when we further adjusted
	for attendance at antenatal care, previous reproductive history,
	or excluded pregnancies with maternal diseases, and pregnancy-related
	disorders. Low social class was most associated with risks of term
	antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES increases
	the risk of stillbirth. The association could not be explained by
	any of the factors we studied, and the underlying reasons remain

  abstract = {CONTEXT: High and low maternal hemoglobin concentrations during pregnancy
	have been reported to increase risk of small-for-gestational-age
	(SGA) birth, which is a predictor of stillbirth. The relationship
	between hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth
	is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To study the associations among hemoglobin
	concentration at first measurement during antenatal care, change
	in hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy, and risk of stillbirth.
	DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based, matched case-control
	study of births from 1987 through 1996 in {S}weden including 702
	primiparous women with stillbirths occurring at 28 weeks' gestation
	or later and 702 primiparous women with live births. MAIN OUTCOME
	MEASURES: Risk of stillbirth, classified as malformed or nonmalformed,
	antepartum or intrapartum, preterm or term, and SGA or non-SGA, compared
	by maternal hemoglobin concentration at first antenatal measurement
	and weekly changes in hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy,
	adjusted for maternal age, body mass index, height, smoking, socioeconomic
	status, and week of first hemoglobin measurement. RESULTS: In multivariate
	analyses, compared with women with hemoglobin concentrations of 126
	to 135 g/L at first antenatal measurement, women with concentrations
	of 146 g/L or higher were at increased risk of stillbirth (odds ratio
	[OR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-3.3). This risk was
	slightly increased when the analysis was restricted to antepartum
	stillbirths without malformations (OR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.1-3.8). When
	we further restricted the analyses to preterm and SGA antepartum
	nonmalformed stillbirths, the ORs increased to 2.7 (95\% CI, 1.1-6.4)
	and 4.2 (95\% CI, 1.3-13. 9), respectively. Excluding women with
	preeclampsia and eclampsia further increased these risks. Average
	weekly change in hemoglobin concentration during early or late pregnancy
	was not significantly associated with risk of stillbirth, although
	a larger decrease in concentration tended to be protective. Anemia
	(hemoglobin concentration <110 g/L) was not significantly associated
	with risk of stillbirth in multivariate analyses (OR, 1.2; 95\% CI,
	0.5-2.7). CONCLUSIONS: High hemoglobin concentration at first measurement
	during antenatal care appears to be associated with increased risk
	of stillbirth, especially preterm and SGA antepartum stillbirths.

	Compared with interpregnancy intervals between 12 and 35 months,

	adjusted for gestational age, birth weight for gestational age, malformations,
	induction of labor, breech presentations and year of birth. RESULTS:
	Infants of high-risk deliveries were more often delivered during
	daytime (8:00 am to 7:59 pm). Compared with infants born during daytime,
	infants born at night were at increased risk of early neonatal death
	(adjusted risk ratio = 1.28; 95\% confidence interval = 1.13-1.46),
	but not intrapartum death (1.05; 0.71-1.54). If this association
	is causal, 12\% of early neonatal deaths can be attributed to the
	increased risk among nighttime births. There was no association of
	weekend or holiday births with risks of intrapartum or early neonatal
	death. CONCLUSIONS: Infants born at night may be at increased risk
	of early neonatal death.},

	and poorly differentiated, their outcomes remain controversial. We
	propose to examine, through a cohort study, the pathologic characteristics,
	overall survival, local recurrence, and metastasis-free intervals
	of 40 patients with BRCA1 breast cancer.A cohort of 183 patients
	with invasive breast cancer, treated at the Institut Curie and presenting
	with a familial history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, were tested
	for BRCA1 germ-line mutation. Tumor characteristics and clinical
	events were extracted from our prospectively registered database.Forty
	BRCA1 mutations were found among the 183 patients (22\%). Median
	follow-up was 58 months. BRCA1 tumors were larger in size (P =.03),
	had a higher rate of grade 3 histoprognostic factors (P =.002), and
	had a higher frequency of negative estrogen (P =.003) and progesterone
	receptors (P =.002) compared with non-BRCA1 tumors. Overall survival
	was poorer for carriers than for noncarriers (5-year rate, 80\% v
	91\%, P =.002). Because a long time interval between cancer diagnosis
	and genetic counseling artificially increases survival time due to
	unrecorded deaths, the analysis was limited to the 110 patients whose
	diagnosis-to-counseling interval was less than 36 months (19 BRCA1
	patients and 91 non-BRCA1 patients). The differences between the
	BRCA1 and non-BRCA1 groups regarding overall survival and metastasis-free
	interval were dramatically increased (49\% v 85\% and 18\% v 84\%,
	respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that BRCA1 mutation was
	an independent prognostic factor.Our results strongly support that

	mutation have a worse outcome than those who do not.},

	years gained by early diagnosis through screening, the probability
	of dying from breast cancer or of dying from other causes during
	the lead time period or thereafter can be derived from information
	on complete survival after diagnosis. A method is presented to estimate
	complete survival and relevant outcomes after diagnosis of screen-detected
	cancer when the follow-up period is substantially shorter than the
	maximum follow-up possible. Survival after diagnosis until death
	from breast cancer is modelled as the sum of the lead time (LT) and
	the post-lead time (PLT), where both time periods follow exponential
	distributions and are assumed to be independent. The survival period
	after diagnosis until death from causes other than breast cancer
	(X) is assumed to follow a Gompertz distribution. The survival period
	after diagnosis until death from any cause (Z) is modelled as the
	minimum of LT+PLT and X. Maximum likelihood methods were then used
	to estimate all parameters of Z. This procedure for obtaining maximum
	likelihood estimates of Z does not need the cause of death (breast
	cancer or other), which is an advantage over most other methods.
	Especially in older patients, it may be difficult or even impossible
	to ascertain the true cause of death. The model was applied to data
	from the long-term breast cancer screening programme in Nijmegen,
	the Netherlands. Complete survival was estimated on the basis of
	survival data on 528 screen-detected breast cancer patients, diagnosed
	in 1975-1997 and with a mean follow-up of 8.9 years. Estimated life
	expectancy ranged between 22.3 and 9.0 years for patients diagnosed
	at the age of 50 and 79 years, respectively, that is, 6.1 and 0.7
	life years gained by screening. Through early diagnosis and treatment,
	screen-detected patients diagnosed at the age of 50 years may have
	reduced their lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer from 79 per
	cent to 56 per cent; at the age of 79 the reduction of risk is reduced
	from 23 per cent to 13 per cent.},

	survival was inferred from the survival among the entire Swedish
	population in the same age, sex and calendar year strata. The 5-year
	observed survival rate for adenocarcinoma increased from a stable
	figure close to 4\% during the entire period 1961-1989 to 10.5\%

	Birth Register, we analyzed data from 1992 through 2001 on births
	of women who delivered live, singleton, term infants without malformations
	(N = 874,163). Unconditional logistic regression was used to model

	increased by 23\% over 10 years. However, the prevalence of overweight

	METHODS: The Swedish Cause of Death Register and Swedish Cancer Register
	were used to identify all parents in {S}weden who had a child who
	died of a malignancy between 1992-1997. RESULTS: Among parents not
	reporting recent depression, those who were not confident that their

	while he or she was sick with a malignancy (compared to those who
	felt partly or entirely sure, relative risk [RR] 4.0; 95\% confidence

	or weekly feelings of guilt in the year after the child's death.
	Parents who perceived that the staff in the pediatric cancer ward
	were incompetent were at increased risk (compared to parents reporting
	partial or total competence, RR 3.7; 95\% CI 1.6-8.6). Compared to
	parents reporting that their children had moderate or much access,
	those who felt their children had little or no access to pain relief,
	dietary advice, anxiety relief, and relief of other psychological
	symptoms beside anxiety were at more than two times greater risk
	for reporting feelings of guilt. CONCLUSIONS: Bereaved parents' perceptions
	of inadequate health care were associated with subsequent feelings
	of guilt during the year following their child's death due to a malignancy.},

	are small for gestational age (have a low birth weight with respect
	to their gestational age) or are delivered preterm (before 37 weeks
	of gestation). It is not known whether the birth of a previous small-for-gestational-age
	or preterm infant increases the subsequent risk of stillbirth. METHODS:
	We assessed the associations between previous adverse outcomes of
	pregnancy and the risk of stillbirth in a nationwide Swedish study
	of 410,021 women who delivered first and second consecutive singleton
	infants between 1983 and 1997. There were 1842 and 1062 stillbirths
	during the first and second pregnancies, respectively. RESULTS: As
	compared with women whose first infant was born at term (37 weeks
	of gestation or more) and was not small for gestational age, women
	whose first infant was born at term or preterm and was small for
	gestational age had an increased risk of stillbirth during their
	second pregnancy. The odds ratios for subsequent stillbirth, after
	adjustment for covariates known to be associated with an increased
	risk of stillbirth, were 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6
	to 2.8) among women with a first infant who was born at term and
	was small for gestational age, 3.4 (95 percent confidence interval,
	2.1 to 5.6) among women with a first infant who was moderately (32
	to 36 weeks of gestation) preterm and small for gestational age,
	and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 9.8) among women
	with a first infant who was very (before 32 weeks of gestation) preterm
	and was small for gestational age. The odds ratio for subsequent
	stillbirth among women with a first stillborn infant was 2.5 (95
	percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.7), as compared with women
	whose first infant was not stillborn. The rates of stillbirth in
	second pregnancies ranged from 2.4 per 1000 births among women whose
	first infant was born at term and was not small for gestational age
	to 19.0 per 1000 births among women whose first child was very preterm
	and was small for gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of a previous
	small-for-gestational-age infant is an important predictor of the
	subsequent risk of stillbirth, particularly if the infant was delivered
	preterm.},

	benefits of treatment outweigh the possible side effects. This study
	revisits the decision whether to use warfarin to treat atrial fibrillation.
	In this analysis, RCT and various sorts of observational data are

	of the original analysis on who would benefit from warfarin; however,
	caution is advised, due to limitations in the quality of life data

	as such underpin much of evidence-based medicine. Despite this, meta-analyses
	are usually produced as observational by-products of the existing
	literature, with no formal consideration of future meta-analyses
	when individual trials are being designed. Basing the sample size
	of a new trial on the results of an updated meta-analysis which will
	include it, may sometimes make more sense than powering the trial
	in isolation. A framework for sample size calculation for a future
	RCT based on the results of a meta-analysis of the existing evidence
	is presented. Both fixed and random effect approaches are explored
	through an example. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation
	modelling is used for the random effects model since it has computational
	advantages over the classical approach. Several criteria on which
	to base inference and hence power are considered. The prior expectation
	of the power is averaged over the prior distribution for the unknown
	true treatment effect. An extension to the framework allowing for
	consideration of the design for a series of new trials is also presented.
	Results suggest that power can be highly dependent on the statistical
	model used to meta-analyse the data and even very large studies may
	have little impact on a meta-analysis when there is considerable
	between study heterogeneity. This raises issues regarding the appropriateness
	of the use of random effect models when designing and drawing inferences

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance of different meta-analysis
	methods for pooling odds ratios when applied to sparse event data
	with emphasis on the use of continuity corrections. BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis
	of side effects from RCTs or risk factors for rare diseases in epidemiological
	studies frequently requires the synthesis of data with sparse event
	rates. Combining such data can be problematic when zero events exist
	in one or both arms of a study as continuity corrections are often
	needed, but, these can influence results and conclusions. METHODS:
	A simulation study was undertaken comparing several meta-analysis
	methods for combining odds ratios (using various classical and Bayesian
	methods of estimation) on sparse event data. Where required, the
	routine use of a constant and two alternative continuity corrections;
	one based on a function of the reciprocal of the opposite group arm
	size; and the other an empirical estimate of the pooled effect size
	from the remaining studies in the meta-analysis, were also compared.
	A number of meta-analysis scenarios were simulated and replicated
	1000 times, varying the ratio of the study arm sizes. RESULTS: Mantel-Haenszel
	summary estimates using the alternative continuity correction factors
	gave the least biased results for all group size imbalances. Logistic
	regression was virtually unbiased for all scenarios and gave good
	coverage properties. The Peto method provided unbiased results for
	balanced treatment groups but bias increased with the ratio of the
	study arm sizes. The Bayesian fixed effect model provided good coverage
	for all group size imbalances. The two alternative continuity corrections
	outperformed the constant correction factor in nearly all situations.
	The inverse variance method performed consistently badly, irrespective
	of the continuity correction used. CONCLUSIONS: Many routinely used
	summary methods provide widely ranging estimates when applied to
	sparse data with high imbalance between the size of the studies'
	arms. A sensitivity analysis using several methods and continuity
	correction factors is advocated for routine practice.},

	{S}weden from 1960 to 1998. A total of 1021421 persons and 40 different
	cancer sites were included in the analyses. The main outcome measure
	is the relative survival rate (RSR) for different sites and follow-up
	times after diagnosis. The 10-year RSR for all sites combined has
	increased steadily-from 26.6\% among men and 41.8\% among women in
	the 1960s, to 44.6\% (men) and 57.6\% (women) in the 1990s. The expectation
	of life for a person diagnosed with cancer today is about 7 years
	longer than that of one diagnosed during the mid-1960s. About 3 years
	are gained due to changes in the relative distribution of various
	cancer types and about 4 years due to improved relative survival.
	During the 1990s substantial survival improvements were observed
	not only for uncommon types, such as testicular cancer, Hodgkin's
	lymphoma and some other haematologic malignancies, but also for cancer
	of the rectum, kidney and malignant melanoma. Survival for breast
	and cervical cancer also improved during the 1990s, but not that
	for pancreatic, liver or lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Relative survival is a widely used measure of cancer patient survival,
	defined as the observed survival of the cancer patients divided by
	the expected survival of a comparable group from the general population,
	free from the cancer under study. In practise, expected survival
	is usually calculated from general population life tables. Such estimates
	are known to be biased since they also include mortality from the
	cancer patients, but the bias is ignored since mortality among individuals
	with a specific cancer is thought to constitute only a small proportion
	of total mortality. Using the computerised population registers that
	exist in Sweden we had the unique opportunity to calculate expected
	survival both including and excluding individuals with cancer, and
	thereby estimate the size of the bias arising from using general
	population estimates. We also evaluated a simple method to adjust
	expected survival probabilities estimated from general population
	statistics as an aid to researchers who do not have access to computerised
	registers of the entire national population. Our results show that
	the bias is sufficiently small to be ignorable for most applications,
	notably for cancers with high or low mortality and for younger age
	groups (<60 years). However, the bias in relative survival estimates
	can be greater than 1 percent unit for older age groups for common
	cancers and even larger for all sites combined. For example, the
	bias in 10-year relative survival for men aged 75+ diagnosed with
	prostate cancer was 2.6 percent units, which we think is of sufficient
	magnitude to warrant adjustment.},

	were not large. However, because of different site distributions,
	the average prognosis for female patients, all sites taken together,
	was superior to that of males: the 5-year relative survival rates
	(RSR) were 58\% and 43\%, respectively. In general, older patients
	had a poorer outcome compared with younger patients (partly because
	of different stage and histology distributions). Stage was a strong
	determinant of patient survival. In some cancers with a poor average
	prognosis the 5-year RSR for localized tumours was reasonable, e.g.
	61\% for stomach cancer, males, 34\% for gallbladder cancer, females,
	and 29\% for lung cancer, males. Most of the survival rates clearly

	accurate estimates of the survival rates of cancer patients in Finland.
	These rates reflect the effectiveness of the healthcare system as

	by a particular disease, the cause of death of individual patients
	is not recorded. In such situations, the conventional survival analytical
	methods, such as the Cox's proportional hazards regression model,
	do not allow to discriminate the effects of prognostic factors on
	disease-specific mortality from their effects on all-causes mortality.
	In the last decade, the relative survival approach has been proposed
	to deal with the analyses involving population-based cancer registries,
	where the problem of missing information on the cause of death is
	very common. However, some questions regarding the ability of the
	relative survival methods to accurately discriminate between the
	two sources of mortality remain open. In order to systematically
	assess the performance of the relative survival model proposed by
	Esteve et al., and to quantify its potential advantages over the
	Cox's model analyses, we carried out a series of simulation experiments,
	based on the population-based colon cancer registry in the French
	region of Burgundy. Simulations showed a systematic bias induced
	by the 'crude' conventional Cox's model analyses when individual
	causes of death are unknown. In simulations where only about 10 per
	cent of patients died of causes other than colon cancer, the Cox's
	model over-estimated the effects of male gender and oldest age category
	by about 17 and 13 per cent, respectively, with the coverage rate
	of the 95 per cent CI for the latter estimate as low as 65 per cent.
	In contrast, the effect of higher cancer stages was under-estimated
	by 8-28 per cent. In contrast to crude survival, relative survival
	model largely reduced such problems and handled well even such challenging
	tasks as separating the opposite effects of the same variable on
	cancer-related versus other-causes mortality. Specifically, in all
	the cases discussed above, the relative bias in the estimates from
	the Esteve et al.'s model was always below 10 per cent, with the
	coverage rates above 81 per cent.},

  abstract = {In a longitudinal clinical study to compare two groups, the primary
	end point is often the time to a specific event (eg, disease progression,
	death). The hazard ratio estimate is routinely used to empirically
	quantify the between-group difference under the assumption that the
	ratio of the two hazard functions is approximately constant over
	time. When this assumption is plausible, such a ratio estimate may
	capture the relative difference between two survival curves. However,
	the clinical meaning of such a ratio estimate is difficult, if not
	impossible, to interpret when the underlying proportional hazards
	assumption is violated (ie, the hazard ratio is not constant over
	time). Although this issue has been studied extensively and various
	alternatives to the hazard ratio estimator have been discussed in
	the statistical literature, such crucial information does not seem
	to have reached the broader community of health science researchers.
	In this article, we summarize several critical concerns regarding
	this conventional practice and discuss various well-known alternatives
	for quantifying the underlying differences between groups with respect
	to a time-to-event end point. The data from three recent cancer clinical
	trials, which reflect a variety of scenarios, are used throughout
	to illustrate our discussions. When there is not sufficient information
	about the profile of the between-group difference at the design stage
	of the study, we encourage practitioners to consider a prespecified,
	clinically meaningful, model-free measure for quantifying the difference

	We have compared structure-function relationships of a series of

	counterparts. In human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, quantification of
	cellular osteocalcin mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis and osteocalcin

	In a study to determine the influence of blood pressure on survival

	that the process that created the missing data depends jointly on

	pressure and then analyse the data under a variety of non-response

	of a predictive model for drawing imputations if the number of variables
	is large. Risk estimates for these data appear robust to even large
	departures from the simplest non-response model, and are similar

	must consider multiple possible outcomes, including the primary outcome
	of interest and other outcomes such as adverse events or mortality.
	The determination of the likelihood of benefit from an intervention,
	in the presence of other competing outcomes, is a competing risks
	problem. Although statistical methods exist for quantifying the probability
	of benefit from an intervention while accounting for competing events,
	these methods have not been widely adopted by clinical researchers.(1)
	To demonstrate the importance of considering competing risks in the
	evaluation of treatment effectiveness, and (2) to review appropriate
	statistical methods, and recommend how they might be applied.We reviewed
	3 statistical approaches for analyzing the competing risks problem:
	(a) cause-specific hazard (CSH), (b) cumulative incidence function
	(CIF), and (c) event-free survival (EFS). We compare these methods
	using a simulation study and a reanalysis of a randomized clinical
	trial.Simulation studies evaluating the statistical power to detect
	the effect of intervention under different scenarios showed that:
	(1) CSH approach is best for detecting the effect of an intervention
	if the intervention only affects either the primary outcome or the
	competing event; (2) EFS approach is best only when the intervention
	affects both primary and competing events in the same manner; and
	(3) CIF approach is best when the intervention affects both primary
	and competing events, but in opposite directions. Using data from
	a randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that a comprehensive
	approach using all 3 approaches provided useful insights on the effect
	of an intervention on the relative and absolute risks of multiple
	competing outcomes.CSH is the fundamental measure of outcome in competing
	risks problems. It is appropriate for evaluating treatment effects
	in the presence of competing events. Results of CSH analysis for
	primary and competing outcomes should always be reported even when
	EFS or CIF approaches are called for. EFS is appropriate for evaluating
	the composite effect of an intervention, only when combining different
	endpoints is clinically and biologically meaningful, and the treatment
	has similar effects on all event types. CIF is useful for evaluating
	the likelihood of benefit from an intervention over a meaningful
	period. CIF should be used for absolute risk calculations instead
	of the widely used complement of the Kaplan-Meier (1 - KM) estimator.},

	mortality is derived as a third step from modelled incidence, prevalence
	and survival. An application to female breast cancer is given for
	the Connecticut State by using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry
	(CTR), 1973-1993. The age, period and cohort model fitted incidence
	quite well and allowed us to derive long-term projections up to 2030.
	Patients' survival was also projected to future years according to
	a scenario approach based on two extreme hypotheses: steady, that
	is, no more improvements after 1993 (conservative), and continuously
	improving at the same rate as during the observation period. Age-standardized
	estimated incidence shows a changing trend around the year 2005,
	when it starts decreasing. Age-standardized prevalence is expected
	to increase and change trend at a later date. Breast cancer mortality
	is projected as decreasing, as the combined result of no further
	increase in incidence and improving cancer patients' survival. An
	easy-to-use PIAMOD software package, on which work is in progress,

  abstract = {The interpretation of time trends and geographical differences of
	population-based survival rates is generally not easy, due to the
	difficulty in disentangling the effects of observational biases,
	diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and their interactions. Whereas
	descriptive analysis of relative survival is generally based on survival
	levels estimated at fixed time since diagnosis, interpretation issues
	can take advantage from the analysis of the shape of the considered
	relative survival. Parametric survival models allowing the estimation
	of the fraction of cured patients are applied here to analyze and
	discuss the differences in colon cancer relative survival between
	European countries, according to age and period of diagnosis. The
	survival curves of colon cancer patients are described according
	to 2 parameters: the proportion of cured patients and the mean survival
	time of fatal cases. These parameters are estimated by least square
	nonlinear regression of relative survival values derived from the
	EUROCARE Project publication. Exponential and Weibull survival functions
	are used to model the relative survival curve for the fraction of
	fatal cases. The Weibull model gives generally a better fit with
	respect to the exponential model, thus indicating that the mortality
	rate for fatal cases is decreasing with time since diagnosis. For
	the youngest patients, however, the 2 survival functions give practically
	overlapping estimates. The overall proportion of colon cancer patients
	in Europe that are estimated to be cured was 38.6\%. This proportion
	increased from 36\% to 40\% for patients diagnosed in 1978-1980 and
	in 1983-1985, respectively. Accordingly, mean survival time of fatal
	cases increased from 1.18 to 1.52 years. According to age, the proportion
	of cured patients present a marked decrease from young (48.4\% at
	age 15-44 years) to middle-aged patients (38.6\% at age 5564 years)
	and only a mild decrease from these to the oldest patients (34.4\%
	at age 75 or more). The opposite effect was shown by survival time
	of fatal cases, i.e., 1.71, 1.75 and 0.77 years for the same age
	classes, respectively. Proportion of cured cases and mean survival
	time of fatal cases tended to be positively correlated with each
	other across countries. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis
	that a real improvement in colon cancer survival took place in Europe
	during the years 1978-1985 and also suggest that the well-known decrease
	of relative survival with age at diagnosis could be mostly due to
	a decreasing efficacy of early diagnosis for patients under 60 years
	old and to less effective therapies for older patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional cancer-survival analyses provide data on cancer
	management at the beginning of a study period, and are often not
	relevant to current practice because they refer to survival of patients
	treated with older regimens that might no longer be used. Therefore,
	shortening the delay in providing survival estimates is desirable.
	Period analysis can estimate cancer survival by the use of recent
	data. We aimed to apply the period-analysis method to data that were
	collected by European cancer registries to estimate recent survival
	by country and cancer site, and to assess survival changes in Europe.
	We also compared our findings with data on cancer survival in the
	USA from the US SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)
	programme. METHODS: We analysed survival data for patients diagnosed
	with cancer in 2000-02, collected from 47 of the European cancer
	registries participating in the EUROCARE-4 study. 5-year period relative
	survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was estimated as the product
	of interval-specific relative survival values of cohorts with different
	lengths of follow-up. 5-year survival profiles for patients diagnosed
	in 2000-02 were estimated for the European mean and for five European
	regions, and findings were compared with US SEER registry data for
	patients diagnosed in 2000-02. A 5-year survival profile for patients
	diagnosed in 1991-2002 and a 10-year survival profile for patients
	diagnosed in 1997-2002 were also estimated by the period method for
	all malignancies, by geographical area, and by cancer site. FINDINGS:
	For all cancers, age-adjusted 5-year period survival improved for
	patients diagnosed in 2000-02, especially for patients with colorectal,
	breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin
	lymphoma. The European mean age-adjusted 5-year survival calculated
	by the period method for 2000-02 was high for testicular cancer (97.3\%
	[95\% CI 96.4-98.2]), melanoma (86.1\% [84.3-88.0]), thyroid cancer
	(83.2\% [80.9-85.6]), Hodgkin's disease (81.4\% [78.9-84.1]), female
	breast cancer (79.0\% [78.1-80.0]), corpus uteri (78.0\% [76.2-79.9]),
	and prostate cancer (77.5\% [76.5-78.6]); and low for stomach cancer
	(24.9\% [23.7-26.2]), chronic myeloid leukaemia (32.2\% [29.0-35.7]),
	acute myeloid leukaemia (14.8\% [13.4-16.4]), and lung cancer (10.9\%
	[10.5-11.4]). Survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was generally
	highest for those in northern European countries and lowest for those
	in eastern European countries, although, patients in eastern European
	had the highest improvement in survival for major cancer sites during
	1991-2002 (colorectal cancer from 30.3\% [28.3-32.5] to 44.7\% [42.8-46.7];
	breast cancer from 60\% [57.2-63.0] to 73.9\% [71.7-76.2]; for prostate
	cancer from 39.5\% [35.0-44.6] to 68.0\% [64.2-72.1]). For all solid
	tumours, with the exception of stomach, testicular, and soft-tissue
	cancers, survival for patients diagnosed in 2000-02 was higher in
	the US SEER registries than for the European mean. For haematological
	malignancies, data from US SEER registries and the European mean
	were comparable in 2000-02, except for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. INTERPRETATION:
	Cancer-service infrastructure, prevention and screening programmes,
	access to diagnostic and treatment facilities, tumour-site-specific
	protocols, multidisciplinary management, application of evidence-based
	clinical guidelines, and recruitment to clinical trials probably
	account for most of the differences that we noted in outcomes.},

	attenuates alpha-naphthylthiourea-induced lung injury by upregulating
	alveolar fluid transport. The objective of this study was to determine
	the effect of KGF pretreatment in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
	A 5\% bovine albumin solution with 1 microCi of (125)I-labeled human
	albumin was instilled into the air spaces 4 or 24 h after intratracheal
	instillation of P. aeruginosa, and the concentration of unlabeled
	and labeled proteins in the distal air spaces over 1 h was used as
	an index of net alveolar fluid clearance. Alveolocapillary barrier
	permeability was evaluated with an intravascular injection of 1 microCi
	of (131)I-albumin. In early pneumonia, KGF increased lung liquid
	clearance (LLC) compared with that in nonpretreated animals. In late
	pneumonia, LLC was significantly reduced in the absence of KGF but
	increased above the control value with KGF. KGF pretreatment increased
	the number of polymorphonuclear cells recovered in the bronchoalveolar
	lavage fluid and decreased bacterial pulmonary translocation. In
	conclusion, KGF restores normal alveolar epithelial fluid transport
	during the acute phase of P. aeruginosa pneumonia and LLC in early
	and late pneumonia. Host response is also improved as shown by the
	increase in the alveolar cellular response and the decrease in pulmonary
	translocation of bacteria.},

	were obtained on all adults (15-99 years) diagnosed with lung cancer
	in 2004-2007 and registered in regional and national cancer registries
	in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK. Stage data
	for 57 352 patients were consolidated from various classification
	systems. Flexible parametric hazard models on the log cumulative
	scale were used to estimate net survival at 1 year and the excess
	hazard up to 18 months after diagnosis.Age-standardised 1-year net
	survival from non-small cell lung cancer ranged from 30\% (UK) to
	46\% (Sweden). Patients in the UK and Denmark had lower survival
	than elsewhere, partly because of a more adverse stage distribution.
	However, there were also wide international differences in stage-specific
	survival. Net survival from TNM stage I non-small cell lung cancer
	was 16\% lower in the UK than in Sweden, and for TNM stage IV disease
	survival was 10\% lower. Similar patterns were found for small cell
	lung cancer.There are comparability issues when using population-based
	data but, even given these constraints, this study shows that, while
	differences in stage at diagnosis explain some of the international
	variation in overall lung cancer survival, wide disparities in stage-specific
	survival exist, suggesting that other factors are also important
	such as differences in treatment. Stage should be included in international
	cancer survival studies and the comparability of population-based

	Our analyses included 12,903 young (30 to 49 years of age) patients

	antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all cardiovascular
	events, stroke and myocardial infarction in the 3 age strata to a

	When covariates are present as often happens in practice, to understand
	covariate effects on the noncured probability and hazard rate is
	of equal importance. The existing methods are limited to parametric
	and semiparametric models. We propose a two-component mixture cure
	rate model with nonparametric forms for both the cure probability

	by an additive assumption that allows no time-covariate interactions
	in the logarithm of hazard rate. Estimation is carried out by an
	expectation-maximization algorithm on maximizing a penalized likelihood.
	For inferential purpose, we apply the Louis formula to obtain point-wise
	confidence intervals for noncured probability and hazard rate. Asymptotic
	convergence rates of our function estimates are established. We then
	evaluate the proposed method by extensive simulations. We analyze

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between
	maternal ambulatory blood pressure monitor measurements during pregnancy
	and birth weight in a population of women considered to have hypertension
	according to conventional antenatal clinic measurement. STUDY DESIGN:
	A prospective observational study was carried out within the obstetric
	departments of Leicester Royal Infirmary and Queen Charlotte's Hospital.
	A total of 237 women were found to have hypertension (blood pressure
	>/=140/90 mm Hg) without significant proteinuria during examination
	in the antenatal assessment area. Sequential-day unit blood pressure
	recordings and a 24-hour automated ambulatory blood pressure recording
	were performed, and the results were compared with the principal
	outcome measure of birth weight. RESULTS: A significant inverse association
	(gradient, -13.5; 95\% confidence interval -23.4 to -3.6) was found
	between daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure measurement and
	birth weight. An increase of 5 mm Hg in daytime mean diastolic blood
	pressure was associated with a fall in birth weight of 68.5 g. This
	association remained after adjustment for potential confounders that
	included maternal age, maternal weight, smoking status, ethnicity,
	and gestational age at delivery. No such association was found between
	obstetric day unit assessment of blood pressure and birth weight.
	CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between blood pressure
	and birth weight in nonproteinuric hypertensive pregnancies. The
	best predictor of this association is the daytime mean ambulatory
	diastolic blood pressure measurement. This is further evidence that
	maternal blood pressure may be an important confounding and potentially
	genetic variable in the association between birth weight and subsequent
	adult hypertension.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Oestrogen receptor alpha, which mediates the effect
	of oestrogen in target tissues, is genetically polymorphic. Because
	breast cancer development is dependent on oestrogenic influence,
	we have investigated whether polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor
	alpha gene (ESR1) are associated with breast cancer risk. METHODS:
	We genotyped breast cancer cases and age-matched population controls
	for one microsatellite marker and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) in ESR1. The numbers of genotyped cases and controls for each
	marker were as follows: TAn, 1514 cases and 1514 controls; c.454-397C
	--> T, 1557 cases and 1512 controls; c.454-351A --> G, 1556 cases
	and 1512 controls; c.729C --> T, 1562 cases and 1513 controls; c.975C
	--> G, 1562 cases and 1513 controls. Using logistic regression models,
	we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
	Haplotype effects were estimated in an exploratory analysis, using
	expectation-maximisation algorithms for case-control study data.
	RESULTS: There were no compelling associations between single polymorphic
	loci and breast cancer risk. In haplotype analyses, a common haplotype
	of the c.454-351A --> G or c.454-397C --> T and c.975C --> G SNPs
	appeared to be associated with an increased risk for ductal breast
	cancer: one copy of the c.454-351A --> G and c.975C --> G haplotype
	entailed an OR of 1.19 (95\% CI 1.06-1.33) and two copies with an
	OR of 1.42 (95\% CI 1.15-1.77), compared with no copies, under a
	model of multiplicative penetrance. The association with the c.454-397C
	--> T and c.975C --> G haplotypes was similar. Our data indicated
	that these haplotypes were more influential in women with a high
	body mass index. Adjustment for multiple comparisons rendered the
	associations statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: We found
	suggestions of an association between common haplotypes in ESR1 and
	the risk for ductal breast cancer that is stronger in heavy women.},

  abstract = {Many patients and clinicians are worried that pregnancy after the
	diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) may increase the risk of relapse
	despite a lack of empirical evidence to support such concerns. We
	investigated if an association exists between pregnancy and relapse
	in women with a diagnosis of HL.Using Swedish healthcare registers
	combined with medical records, we included 449 women who received
	a diagnosis of HL between 1992 and 2009 and who were age 18 to 40
	years at diagnosis. Follow-up started 6 months after diagnosis, when
	the patients' condition was assumed to be in remission. Pregnancy-associated
	relapse was defined as a relapse during pregnancy or within 5 years
	after delivery. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% CIs were estimated
	by using the Cox proportional hazards model.Among the 449 women,
	144 (32\%) became pregnant during follow-up. Overall, 47 relapses
	were recorded, of which one was a pregnancy-associated relapse. The
	adjusted HR for the comparison of the pregnancy-associated relapse
	rate to the non-pregnancy-associated relapse rate was 0.29 (95\%
	CI, 0.04 to 2.18). The expected number of relapses in women with
	a recent pregnancy, given that they would experience the same relapse
	rate as that of women without a recent pregnancy, was 3.76; the observed-to-expected
	ratio was 0.27 (95\% exact CI, 0.01 to 1.51).We found no evidence
	that a pregnancy after diagnosis increases the relapse rate among
	women whose HL is in remission. Survivors of HL need to consider
	a range of factors when deciding about future reproduction. However,
	given the results of this study, the risk of pregnancy-associated
	relapse does not need to be considered.},

	used by cancer registries throughout the world, making international
	data comparisons difficult. This study evaluates the effect of Surveillance,
	Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and International Association
	of Cancer Registries (IACR) MP rules on population-based cancer survival
	estimates.Data from five US states and six metropolitan area cancer
	registries participating in the SEER Program were used to estimate
	age-standardized relative survival (RS\%) for first cancers-only
	and all first cancers matching the selection criteria according to
	SEER and IACR MP rules for all cancer sites combined and for the
	top 25 cancer site groups among men and women.During 1995-2008, the
	percentage of MP cancers (all sites, both sexes) increased 25.4 \%
	by using SEER rules (from 14.6 to 18.4 \%) and 20.1 \% by using IACR
	rules (from 13.2 to 15.8 \%). More MP cancers were registered among
	females than among males, and SEER rules registered more MP cancers
	than IACR rules (15.8 vs. 14.4 \% among males; 17.2 vs. 14.5 \% among
	females). The top 3 cancer sites with the largest differences were
	melanoma (5.8 \%), urinary bladder (3.5 \%), and kidney and renal
	pelvis (2.9 \%) among males, and breast (5.9 \%), melanoma (3.9 \%),
	and urinary bladder (3.4 \%) among females. Five-year survival estimates
	(all sites combined) restricted to first primary cancers-only were
	higher than estimates by using first site-specific primaries (SEER
	or IACR rules), and for 11 of 21 sites among males and 11 of 23 sites
	among females. SEER estimates are comparable to IACR estimates for
	all site-specific cancers and marginally higher for all sites combined
	among females (RS 62.28 vs. 61.96 \%).Survival after diagnosis has
	improved for many leading cancers. However, cancer patients remain
	at risk of subsequent cancers. Survival estimates based on first
	cancers-only exclude a large and increasing number of MP cancers.
	To produce clinically and epidemiologically relevant and less biased
	cancer survival estimates, data on all cancers should be included
	in the analysis. The multiple primary rules (SEER or IACR) used to
	identify primary cancers do not affect survival estimates if all
	first cancers matching the selection criteria are used to produce
	site-specific survival estimates.},

  abstract = {Cancer mortality should include not only deaths from cancer but also
	deaths from cancer treatment. By convention, deaths within 30 days
	of a surgical procedure are considered treatment-related deaths in
	the calculation of operative mortality-that is, the chance of dying
	from surgery. How cause of death is attributed in patients who die
	within 1 month of cancer-directed surgery is unknown.The National
	Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
	program data from 1994 through 1998 were used to examine the cause
	of death in patients diagnosed with one of 19 common solid tumors
	who had died within 1 month of diagnosis and had also received cancer-directed
	surgery. We determined the proportion of deaths not attributed to
	the cancer and the magnitude of the undercount in cancer-specific
	mortality.Among 4135 patients with only one cancer who died within
	1 month of diagnosis and cancer-directed surgery, the proportion
	of deaths not attributed to the coded cancer was 41\% (1714/4135),
	ranging from 13\% (1/8) for cervical cancer to 81\% (13/16) for laryngeal
	cancer. Selected intermediate values include 25\% (14/56) for esophageal
	cancer, 34\% (177/525) for lung cancer, 42\% (719/1695) for colorectal
	cancer, 59\% (110/186) for breast cancer, and 75\% (80/106) for prostate
	cancer. Restricting the analysis to deaths following specific major
	procedures (e.g., esophagectomy, pneumonectomy, colectomy) had little
	effect on the findings. If all deaths within 1 month of cancer-directed
	surgery were attributed to cancer, cancer mortality would rise about
	1\%.Some deaths that are conventionally attributed to surgery are
	not being attributed to the cancer for which the surgery was performed.
	Although the estimated effect of this misclassification on overall
	cancer mortality is modest, it may be indicative of more widespread
	confusion about how to code treatment-related deaths of patients
	with cancer.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Increased 5-year survival for cancer patients is generally
	inferred to mean that cancer treatment has improved and that fewer
	patients die of cancer. Increased 5-year survival, however, may also
	reflect changes in diagnosis: finding more people with early-stage
	cancer, including some who would never have become symptomatic from
	their cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship over time
	between 5-year cancer survival and 2 other measures of cancer burden,
	mortality and incidence. DESIGN AND SETTING: Using population-based
	statistics reported by the National Cancer Institute Surveillance,
	Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we calculated the change in
	5-year survival from 1950 to 1995 for the 20 most common solid tumor
	types. Using the tumor as the unit of analysis, we correlated changes
	in 5-year survival with changes in mortality and incidence. MAIN
	OUTCOME MEASURE: The association between changes in 5-year survival
	and changes in mortality and incidence measured using simple correlation
	coefficients (Pearson and Spearman). RESULTS: From 1950 to 1995,
	there was an increase in 5-year survival for each of the 20 tumor
	types. The absolute increase in 5-year survival ranged from 3\% (pancreatic
	cancer) to 50\% (prostate cancer). During the same period, mortality
	rates declined for 12 types of cancer and increased for the remaining
	8 types. There was little correlation between the change in 5-year
	survival for a specific tumor and the change in tumor-related mortality
	(Pearson r=.00; Spearman r=-.07). On the other hand, the change in
	5-year survival was positively correlated with the change in the
	tumor incidence rate (Pearson r=+. 49; Spearman r=+.37). CONCLUSION:
	Although 5-year survival is a valid measure for comparing cancer
	therapies in a randomized trial, our analysis shows that changes
	in 5-year survival over time bear little relationship to changes
	in cancer mortality. Instead, they appear primarily related to changing
	patterns of diagnosis. JAMA. 2000.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is commonly used to impute missing data, and is
	typically more efficient than complete cases analysis in regression
	analysis when covariates have missing values. Imputation may be performed
	using a regression model for the incomplete covariates on other covariates
	and, importantly, on the outcome. With a survival outcome, it is
	a common practice to use the event indicator D and the log of the
	observed event or censoring time T in the imputation model, but the
	rationale is not clear.We assume that the survival outcome follows
	a proportional hazards model given covariates X and Z. We show that
	a suitable model for imputing binary or Normal X is a logistic or
	linear regression on the event indicator D, the cumulative baseline
	hazard H(0)(T), and the other covariates Z. This result is exact
	in the case of a single binary covariate; in other cases, it is approximately
	valid for small covariate effects and/or small cumulative incidence.
	If we do not know H(0)(T), we approximate it by the Nelson-Aalen
	estimator of H(T) or estimate it by Cox regression.We compare the
	methods using simulation studies. We find that using logT biases
	covariate-outcome associations towards the null, while the new methods
	have lower bias. Overall, we recommend including the event indicator
	and the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H(T) in the imputation model.},

  abstract = {In France, the decline in marital fertility began in 1800 and preceded
	the marital decline in other European countries by about 70 years.
	The French decline is generally regarded as differing from the decline
	in other European countries only in timing, and the decline in all
	these countries is attributed to the innovative use of modern fertility
	control methods, which once introduced, were widely and rapidly accepted.
	An alternative explanation for the early decline in French fertility
	is presented. It is argued that the fertility decline in France between
	1800 and 1980 reflects an adjustment process. It was suggested that
	in a peasant society, in contrast to an industrial society, there
	are only a limited number of available economic niches, and economic
	pressures will be intense if the population growth rate increases
	rapidly. In order to keep the population growth rate in balance with
	the economic resources, the net reproductive rate (NRR) must be kept
	near unity. In France, unity was maintained by keeping the marital
	fertility rate in balance with the nuptiality and mortality rates.
	Data on the population growth rates, mortality rates, marital fertility
	rates, NRRs, and on life expectancy is presented to support this
	argument. In France, between 1700-1800, the population increased
	by 35\% and between 1800-1900 by 38\%. This increase was exremely
	small compared to that which occurred in other European countries.
	For example, in England the corresponding increases were 71\% and
	252\%. These differences in growth were the result of differences
	in the marital fertility patterns of the 2 countries. Before 1800,
	marital fertility in France was similar to that of other European
	countries, but after 1800 the French rate declined rapidly. By 1840
	it was 2/3 of the 1800 level, and by 1900 it was 1/2 of the 1800
	level. In other European countries marital fertility did not begin
	to decline until the 1870s. The decline in France differed not only
	in timing, but in form. When these declines were plotted on a line
	graph, the differences in form were immediately apparent. The French
	decline was choppy, and there is even an increase in marital fertility
	between 1850-1870. In contrast, the decline in other European countries
	was sharp, consistent, and smooth. During the 1700s in France there
	was a marked increase in the age at marriage and in the proportion
	of never married individuals. By the late 1700s a strain in the nuptiality
	pattern was evidenced by a marked increase in the illegitimacy rate
	and in the number of premarital pregnancies among brides. Subsequently,
	there was an increase in the nuptiality rate. In addition, life expectancy
	leaped from 28-39 years between 1790-1820. To compensate for both
	the increase in nuptiality and the decline in mortality, couples
	apparently limited births. These efforts to keep the marital fertility
	rate, the mortality rate, and the nuptiality rate in balance are
	evidenced in the NRR which varied from only 0.97-1.08 throughout
	the 1740-1880 period. The adjustment explanation is supported by
	the fact that while the marital fertility rate varied between 1740-1880,
	the NRR rate; remained stable. A subsequent paper will analyze regional
	differences. In using a equilbrium model, it is necessary to determine
	if the unity observed in the national NRR is a statistical artifact,
	resulting from large regional differences canceling each other out
	at the national level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The question of curability of breast carcinoma remains
	controversial. Because the probability of cure essentially is an
	asymptotic notion, the corresponding estimation problems call for
	special statistical methods. Such methods should account for an intimate
	connection between the probability of cure and the shape of the hazard
	function. METHODS: The study was performed on survival data for 13,166
	women with breast carcinoma identified through the Utah Cancer Registry
	and stratified by clinical stage and age at diagnosis. For these
	patients, the follow-up period was 30 years. Three estimation procedures
	were used for estimating the hazard function from the data: the life
	table estimator, a kernel counterpart of the Nelson-Aalen estimator,
	and a parametric estimator specifically designed for two-component
	hazards. The parametric estimate of the hazard function was used
	to provide estimates of cure rates for each category of patients.
	RESULTS: For all categories of patients under study, the estimated
	hazard functions passed through a clear-cut maximum, showing a tendency
	to decrease as time approached the end of a follow-up period. The
	hazards appeared to be nonproportional across the strata. The estimated
	values of the cure rate and the corresponding confidence intervals
	were determined for each stratum of patients with breast carcinoma.
	CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study strongly suggest that
	cure is a possible outcome of breast carcinoma treatment. The condition
	of proportionality of risks is not met in breast carcinoma survival

  abstract = {In randomized clinical trials comparing treatment effects on diseases
	such as cancer, a multicentre trial is usually conducted to accrue
	the required number of patients within a reasonable period of time.
	The fundamental point of conducting a multicentre trial is that all
	participating investigators must agree to follow the common study
	protocol. However, even with every attempt having been made to standardize
	the methods for diagnosing severity of disease and evaluating response
	to treatment, for example, they might be applied differently at different
	centres, and these may vary from comprehensive cancer centres to
	university hospitals to community hospitals. Therefore, in multicentre
	trials there is likely to be some degree of variation (heterogeneity)
	among centres in both the baseline risks and the treatment effects.
	While we estimate the overall treatment effect using a summary measure
	such as hazard ratio and usually interpret it as an average treatment
	effect over the centre, it is necessary to examine the homogeneity
	of the observed treatment effects across centres, that is, treatment-by-centre
	interaction. If the data are reasonably consistent with homogeneity
	of the observed treatment effects across centres, a single summary
	measure is adequate to describe the trial results and those results
	will contribute to the scientific generalization, the process of
	synthesizing knowledge from observations. On the other hand, if heterogeneity
	of treatment effects is found, we should carefully interpret the
	trial results and investigate the reason why the variation is seen.
	In the analyses of multicentre trials, a random effects approach
	is often used to model the centre effects. In this article, we focus
	on the proportional hazards models with random effects to examine
	centre variation in the treatment effects as well as the baseline
	risks, and review the parameter estimation procedures, frequentist
	approach-penalized maximum likelihood method--and Bayesian approach--Gibbs
	sampling method. We also briefly review the models for bivariate
	responses. We present a few real data examples from the biometrical

	taken during a period of up to 26 years before diagnosis. We calculated
	C, values, which decrease as the number of viral DNA copies increases.
	FINDINGS: 2081 smears from 478 cases and 1754 smears from 608 controls
	were tested. Among cases, we found a consistently increased load
	of HPV 16 already 13 years or more before diagnosis, and when many
	smears were still cytologically normal. Women with high HPV 16 viral
	loads were at least 30 times the relative risk of HPV-16-negative
	women more than a decade before diagnosis. The increase in relative
	risk was constant over time. About 25\% of women (95\% CI 0.12-0.32)
	infected with a high viral load before age 25 years developed cervical
	carcinoma in situ within 15 years. INTERPRETATION: Cervical carcinoma
	in situ associated with HPV 16 occurs mainly in HPV-16-positive women
	who have consistently high viral loads long term. Women at high risk
	could be identified by use of a quantitative HPV test in addition
	to cytological screening.},

	of respiratory survey questions about wheeze, shortness of breath,
	and cough. METHODS: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.
	Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Nineteen
	parents of children aged under 6 years were recruited from a cohort
	of parents who had responded to an earlier respiratory symptom survey
	and from one general practice. RESULTS: Parents judged respiratory
	symptoms using a range of cues, including changes in the sound of
	breathing and changes in appearance and behaviour. Experiential resources
	and contextual factors played an important role in parents' judgements.
	Interpretations of questions about respiratory symptoms were varied,
	particularly in relation to the terms "attacks of wheeze" and "shortness
	of breath". Parents' descriptions of wheeze differed from descriptions
	of the sound of wheeze used in some survey questionnaires. Parents
	drew fine distinctions between different "types" of cough and identified
	a distinct "asthma" cough. CONCLUSIONS: Attention needs to be given
	to the complexity of reporting respiratory symptoms in children and
	to the importance of contextual factors in parents' judgements. We
	suggest that questions which require parents to report on children's
	internal feelings or states be avoided. Consideration should be given
	to providing parents with explicit direction on what cues to attend
	to or ignore in reporting symptoms, and to clarifying some questions
	that are currently used in clinical practice and in surveys.},

	the effectiveness of treatment and early diagnosis. The ultimate
	goal of cancer research and patient care is the cure of cancer. As
	cancer treatments progress, cure becomes a reality for many cancers
	if patients are diagnosed early and get effective treatment. If a
	cure does exist for a certain type of cancer, it is useful to estimate
	the time of cure. For cancers that impose excess risk of mortality,
	it is informative to understand the difference in survival between
	cancer patients and the general cancer-free population. In population-based
	cancer survival studies, relative survival is the standard measure
	of excess mortality due to cancer. Cure is achieved when the survival
	of cancer patients is equivalent to that of the general population.
	This definition of cure is usually called the statistical cure, which
	is an important measure of burden due to cancer. In this paper, a
	minimum version of the log-rank test is proposed to test the equivalence
	of cancer patients' survival using the relative survival data. Performance
	of the proposed test is evaluated by simulation. Relative survival

	measures the net survival (excess mortality) due to cancer when the

	when the cause of death is uncertain or unavailable, relative survival,
	the ratio of the survival rate due to all causes to the expected
	survival rate, is more appropriate. There is a large body of work
	on the modelling and hypothesis testing of cause-specific survival,
	but many of these methods are not directly applicable to relative
	survival. In this paper, we extend the multiple imputation (MI) methods
	(Stat. Methods Med. Res. 1999; 8:3-15) to the case of relative survival
	data. The MI methodology is combined with relative survival to estimate
	the net survival by changing relative survival data to cause-specific
	data. This facilitates the direct application to statistical methods
	developed for the cause-specific survival to the special situation
	of relative survival. The parameter estimates and the log-rank statistics
	are obtained by combining the results from multiple imputed cause-specific

	data have been implemented by a Windows application called CANSURV

	led to similar estimates of the proportion cured. The estimates varied
	slightly when cure was a reasonable assumption but the distributional
	assumption was not (e.g., for colon cancer patients older than 75
	years). Greater variability in the estimates was observed when the
	cure assumption was not supported by the data (breast cancer).If
	the data suggest cure is not a reasonable assumption then we advise

	cancer types diagnosed in each of 17 health service regions in New
	South Wales, Australia, from 1991 to 1998. Region-specific risks
	of excess death due to cancer were estimated adjusting for age, sex,
	and extent of disease at, and years since, diagnosis. Empirical Bayes
	(EB) methods were used to shrink the estimates. The additional numbers
	of patients who would survive beyond five years were estimated by
	shifting the State average risk to the 20th centile. RESULTS: Statistically
	significant regional variation in the shrunken estimates of risk
	of excess death was found for nine of the 25 cancer types. The lives
	of 2903 people (6.4\%) out of the 45,047 whose deaths within 5 years
	were attributable to cancer could be extended with the highest number
	being for lung cancer (791). CONCLUSIONS: The EB approach gives more
	precise estimates of region-specific risk of excess death and is
	preferable to standard methods for identifying cancer sites where
	gains in survival might be made. The estimated number of lives that
	could be extended can assist health authorities in prioritising investigation

	undergoing nonemergent surgery should receive adjuvant chemotherapy
	routinely. Clinicopathologic and prognostic data of 333 stage II
	colon cancer patients who underwent D2 or D3 lymphadenectomy during
	nonemergent surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Four pathologically
	determined factors, including adjacent organ involvement (RR 2.831,
	P = 0.001), histologic differentiation (RR 2.151, P = 0.009), lymphovascular
	invasion (RR 4.043, P < 0.001), and number of lymph nodes retrieved
	(RR 2.161, P = 0.011), were identified as independent prognostic
	factors on multivariate analysis. Importantly, a simple cumulative
	scoring system clearly categorizing prognostic risk groups was generated:
	risk score = ? coefficient' {\AA} status (AOI + histological differentiated
	+ lymphovascular invasion + LNs retrieved). Our new prognostic model
	may provide valuable information on the impact of lymphovascular
	invasion, as well as powerfully and reliably predicting prognosis
	and recurrence for this particular cohort of patients. This model
	may identify suitable patients with an R0 resection who should receive
	routine postoperative adjuvant therapy and may help clinicians to
	facilitate individualized treatment. In this study, we aim to provide
	an ideal and quantifiable method for clinical decision making in
	the nonemergent surgical treatment of stage II colon cancer. Our
	prognostic and predictive model should be applied in multicenter,
	prospective studies with large sample sizes, in order to obtain a
	more reliable clinical recommendation.},

	to different causes of failure, where each cause is known as a competing
	risk. The cumulative incidence curve is a proper summary curve, showing
	the cumulative failure rates over time due to a particular cause.
	A common question in medical research is to assess the covariate
	effects on a cumulative incidence function. The standard approach
	is to construct regression models for all cause-specific hazard rate
	functions and then model a covariate-adjusted cumulative incidence
	curve as a function of all cause-specific hazards for a given set
	of covariates. New methods have been proposed in recent years, emphasizing
	direct assessment of covariate effects on cumulative incidence function.
	Fine and Gray proposed modeling the effects of covariates on a subdistribution
	hazard function. A different approach is to directly model a covariate-adjusted
	cumulative incidence function, including a pseudovalue approach by
	Andersen and Klein and a direct binomial regression by Scheike, Zhang
	and Gerds. In this paper, we review the standard and new regression
	methods for modeling a cumulative incidence function, and give the
	sources of computer packages/programs that implement these regression
	models. A real bone marrow transplant data set is analyzed to illustrate
	various regression methods.},

  abstract = {As part of the preparation for the forth-coming UN International Conference
	on Population and Development, an expert group met in Paris, France,
	in November 1992 to discuss population growth and demographic structure.
	As part of the demographic background for the meeting provided by
	the UN Population Division, participants were informed that although
	the world population growth rate began to decline in the late 1970s,
	this decline has not yet resulted in declining absolute numbers,
	and the annual increment to the world population was not expected
	to decline to the level that existed in 1985 until the period 2020-25.
	World population increased from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 5.3 billion
	in 1990. The medium variant population projection of the UN shows
	world population at 6.3 billion in 2000 and 8.5 billion in 2025 (the
	high variant shows 9.4 billion in 2025 and the low variant shows
	7.6 billion). Population aging is expected to reach unparalleled
	levels in 2010-20. The meeting then considered the topics of population
	growth and socioeconomic development, confronting poverty in developing
	countries, demographic impacts of development patterns, demographic
	and health transitions, population growth and employment, social
	change and the elderly in developing countries, and social development
	and ageing in developed countries, The expert group meeting then
	prepared 19 recommendations aimed at governments, social institutions,
	and the international community. The recommendations call for political
	commitment to human resources development and population and development
	programs, especially in least developed countries, alleviation of
	poverty and social inequality, and equality of access to social and
	health resources that will lead to reduced mortality and fertility.
	Governments are urged to place a high priority on education and on
	increasing women's access to education and to remove barriers to
	economic independence for women. Health-sector priorities should
	be reassessed to provide the most cost-effective and efficient means

  abstract        = {Survival has risen steadily since the 1970s for most cancers in adults in England and Wales, but persistent inequalities exist between those living in affluent and deprived areas. These differences are not seen for children. For many of the common adult cancers, these inequalities in survival (the 'deprivation gap') became more marked in the 1990s. This volume presents extended analyses of survival for adults diagnosed during the 14 years 1986-1999 and followed up to 2001, including trends in overall survival in England and Wales and trends in the deprivation gap in survival. The analyses include individual tumour data for 2.2 million cancer patients. This article outlines the structure of the supplement - an article for each of the 20 most common cancers in adults, followed by an expert commentary from one of the leading UK clinicians specialising in malignancies of that organ or system. The available data, quality control and methods of analysis are described here, rather than repeated in each of the 20 articles. We open the discussion between clinicians and epidemiologists on how to interpret the observed trends and inequalities in cancer survival, and we highlight some of the most important contrasts in these very different points of view. Survival improved substantially for adult cancer patients in England and Wales up to the end of the 20th century. Although socioeconomic inequalities in survival are remarkably persistent, the overall patterns suggest that these inequalities are largely avoidable.},

  abstract        = {The National Health Service (NHS) cancer plan for England was published in 2000, with the aim of improving the survival of patients with cancer. By contrast, a formal cancer strategy was not implemented in Wales until late 2006. National data on cancer patient survival in England and Wales up to 2007 thus offer the opportunity for a first formal assessment of the cancer plan in England, by comparing survival trends in England with those in Wales before, during, and after the implementation of the plan. We analysed population-based survival in 2.2 million adults diagnosed with one of 21 common cancers in England and Wales during 1996-2006 and followed up to Dec 31, 2007. We defined three calendar periods: 1996-2000 (before the cancer plan), 2001-03 (initialisation), and 2004-06 (implementation). We estimated year-on-year trends in 1-year relative survival for patients diagnosed during each period, and changes in those trends between successive periods in England and separately in Wales. Changes between successive periods in mean survival up to 5 years after diagnosis were analysed by country and by government office region of England. Life tables for single year of age, sex, calendar year, deprivation category, and government office region were used to control for background mortality in all analyses. 1-year survival in England and Wales improved for most cancers in men and women diagnosed during 1996-2006 and followed until 2007, although not all trends were significant. Annual trends were generally higher in Wales than in England during 1996-2000 and 2001-03, but higher in England than in Wales during 2004-06. 1-year survival for patients diagnosed in 2006 was over 60% for 12 of 17 cancers in men and 13 of 18 cancers in women. Differences in 3-year survival trends between England and Wales were less marked than the differences in 1-year survival. North-South differences in survival trends for the four most common cancers were not striking, but the North West region and Wales showed the smallest improvements during 2001-03 and 2004-06. The findings indicate slightly faster improvement in 1-year survival in England than in Wales during 2004-06, whereas the opposite was true during 2001-03. This reversal of survival trends in 2001-03 and 2004-06 between England and Wales is much less obvious for 3-year survival. These different patterns of survival suggest some beneficial effect of the NHS cancer plan for England, although the data do not so far provide a definitive assessment of the effectiveness of the plan.},

The NHS Cancer Plan (2000) aimed to improve survival and reduce these inequalities. This study examines trends in the deprivation gap in cancer survival after implementation of the Plan. We examined relative survival among adults diagnosed with 1 of 21 common cancers in England during 1996-2006, followed up to 31 December 2007. Three periods were defined: 1996-2000 (before the Cancer Plan), 2001-2003 (initialisation) and 2004-2006 (implementation). We estimated the difference in survival between the most deprived and most affluent groups (deprivation gap) at 1 and 3 years after diagnosis, and the change in the deprivation gap both within and between these periods. Survival improved for most cancers, but inequalities in survival were still wide for many cancers in 2006. Only the deprivation gap in 1-year survival narrowed slightly over time. A majority of the socioeconomic disparities in survival occurred soon after a cancer diagnosis, regardless of the cancer prognosis. The recently observed reduction in the deprivation gap was minor and limited to 1-year survival, suggesting that, so far, the Cancer Plan has little effect on those inequalities. Our findings highlight that earlier diagnosis and rapid access to optimal treatment should be ensured for all socioeconomic groups.},

Socioeconomic status according to fifths of small area deprivation index. Over the nine years of the study, information on stage at diagnosis was available for 15 916 of 27 970 patients (57%). During the study period, the proportion of patients treated with radiotherapy remained at about 25%, while use of radical surgery increased significantly (from 2.9% (212/7201) during 1995-7 to 8.4% (854/10 211) during 2004-6, P<0.001). Both treatments were more commonly used in least deprived compared with most deprived patients (28.5% v 21.0% for radiotherapy and 8.4% v 4.0% for surgery). In multivariable analysis, increasing deprivation remained strongly associated with lower odds of radiotherapy or surgery (odds ratio 0.92 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.94), P<0.001, and 0.91 (0.87 to 0.94), P<0.001, respectively, per incremental deprivation group). There were consistently concordant findings with multilevel models for clustering of observations by hospital of diagnosis, with restriction of the analysis to patients with information on stage, and with sequential restriction of the analysis to different age, stage, diagnosis period, and morphology groups. After a diagnosis of prostate cancer, men from lower socioeconomic groups were substantially less likely to be treated with radical surgery or radiotherapy. The causes and impact on survival of such differences remain uncertain.},

We assigned each patient to an urbanization score and to a socioeconomic quintile based on their postcode of residence. We calculated age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates (per 100,000 European standard population) by urbanization, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation group. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to compare the survival of patients from urban and rural areas by socioeconomic deprivation. A high proportion of urban areas in England were classified as deprived and rural areas were mostly affluent. The incidence of lung cancer was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. In the more affluent areas, the incidence of lung cancer in urban and rural areas was very similar. Survival from lung cancer was slightly higher in affluent areas than in deprived areas. Survival from lung cancer in urban and rural areas was similar across all socioeconomic deprivation quintiles. The difference in incidence between urban and rural areas can be explained by the differences in the distribution of socioeconomic deprivation quintiles in the two urbanization categories. When socioeconomic deprivation is taken into account, little difference is seen between both the incidence and survival of lung cancer in urban and rural areas.},

Data on 11 957 breast cancers in London women aged 50-64 between 1998 and 2005 were extracted from the Thames Cancer Registry. We investigated the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and the incidence and 5-year relative survival of screen-detected and non screen-detected cancers. Using logistic regression analysis we explored whether differences in screen-detected cancers between White, Asian and Black women were influenced by age and socioeconomic deprivation. The incidence of screen-detected breast cancer was lower in deprived women and their 5-year relative survival was worse than affluent women. However, survival differences were smaller for screen-detected disease. Among women with breast cancer the odds ratios (OR) for screen-detected disease differed between ethnic groups and these differences were not influenced by adjustment for age and deprivation. Compared with White women, Indian women had higher odds (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval (1.23-1.84)], and Black Caribbean [0.68 (0.54-0.87)] and Black African women [0.53 (0.38-0.76)] significantly lower odds. A sustained focus on increasing screening uptake among deprived women and in Black communities could decrease inequalities in early diagnosis.},

We included 21,334 men aged > or = 55, diagnosed between 2000 and 2006. Principal treatment received was categorised into radical prostatectomy (11%), brachytherapy (2%), external beam radiotherapy (16%), hormone therapy (42%) and no treatment (29%). The odds ratio (OR) for receiving a radical prostatectomy was 1.53 in 2006 compared with 2000 (95% CI 1.26-1.86), whereas the OR for receiving hormone therapy was 0.57 (0.51-0.64). Age was strongly associated with treatment received; radical treatments were significantly less likely in men aged > or = 75 compared with men aged 55-64 years, whereas the odds of receiving hormone therapy or no treatment were significantly higher in the older age group. The OR for receiving radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy were all significantly lower in the most deprived areas when compared with the most affluent (0.64 (0.55-0.75), 0.32 (0.22-0.47) and 0.83 (0.74-0.94), respectively) whereas the OR for receiving hormone therapy was 1.56 (1.42-1.71). This study highlights the variation and inequalities that exist in the management of non-metastatic prostate cancer in the Northern and Yorkshire region of England.},

  abstract        = {In a large population-based series of invasive breast cancer patients, we investigated socioeconomic background (SEB) in relation to (a) stage at diagnosis; (b) treatment pattern; and (c) 5-year survival. Women diagnosed during 1998-2000 and resident in the Northern and Yorkshire regions of England were identified from the cancer registry database (N=12,768). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate associations between SEB (defined using the Townsend Index for area of residence) and tumour stage, treatment pattern, and survival. Living in a more deprived area was associated with increased likelihood of being diagnosed with stage III or IV disease (age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.18 per quartile increase in Townsend score), and, after adjustment for age and stage, reduced odds of having surgery (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80-0.91), and receiving radiotherapy (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.88-0.94). Amongst patients receiving surgery, those living in more deprived areas had decreased odds of having breast conserving surgery (age plus stage-adjusted OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.89-0.95). Living in a more deprived area was also associated with increased mortality (age- plus stage-adjusted hazard ratio 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.11). These effects may operate through several pathways, such as later presentation leading to advanced disease.},

  abstract        = {Cancer incidence varies by socioeconomic group and these variations have been linked with environmental and lifestyle factors, differences in access to health care and health seeking behaviour. Socioeconomic variations in cancer incidence by region and age are less clearly understood but they are crucial for targeting prevention measures and health care commissioning. Data were obtained from all eight English cancer registries for patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2003, for all invasive cases of female breast cancer (ICD-10 code C50), lung cancer (ICD-10 codes C33-C34), cervical cancer (ICD-10 code C53), and malignant melanoma of the skin (ICD-10 code C43). Socioeconomic status was assigned to each patient based on their postcode of residence at diagnosis, using the income domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004. We analysed the socioeconomic variations in the incidence of breast, lung and cervical cancer and malignant melanoma of the skin for England, and regionally and by age. Incidence was highest for the most deprived patients for lung cancer and cervical cancer, whilst the opposite was observed for malignant melanoma and breast cancer. The difference in incidence between the most and the least deprived groups was higher for lung cancer patients aged under 65 at diagnosis than those over 65 at diagnosis, which may indicate a cohort effect. There were regional differences in the socioeconomic gradients with the gap being widest for lung and cervical cancer in the North (North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humberside) and for malignant melanoma in the East and South West. There were only modest variations in breast cancer incidence by region. If the incidence of lung and cervical cancer were decreased to that of the least deprived group it would prevent 36% of lung cancer cases in men, 38% of lung cancer cases in women and 28% of cervical cancer cases. Incidence of breast cancer and melanoma was highest in the least deprived group, therefore if all socioeconomic groups had incidence rates similar to the least deprived group it is estimated that the number of cases would increase by 7% for breast cancer, 27% for melanoma in men and 29% for melanoma in women. National comparison of socioeconomic variations in cancer incidence by region and age can provide an unbiased basis for public health prevention and health commissioning. Decreasing inequalities in incidence requires the integration of information on risk factors, incidence and projected incidence but targeted public health interventions could help to reduce regional inequalities in incidence and reduce the future cancer burden.},

The excess hazard of breast cancer death in 20,265 women diagnosed with breast cancer, followed up to 2012, was estimated for screen-detected and non-screen-detected women, comparing more deprived to less deprived women using flexible parametric models. Models were adjusted for individual and tumor factors, treatment received and comorbidity. For screen-detected women, estimates were also corrected for lead-time and overdiagnosis. The excess hazard ratio (EHR) of breast cancer death in the most deprived group, adjusted only for age and year of diagnosis, was twice that of the least deprived among screen-detected women (EHR=2.12, 95%CI 1.48-2.76) and 64% higher among non-screen-detected women (EHR=1.64, 95%CI 1.41-1.87). Adjustment for stage at diagnosis lowered these estimates by 25%. Further adjustment had little extra impact. In the final models, the excess hazard for the most deprived women was 54% higher (EHR=1.54, 95%CI 1.10-1.98) among screen-detected women and 39% higher (EHR=1.39, 95%CI 1.20-1.59) among non-screen-detected women. A persistent socio-economic gradient in breast cancer-related death exists in this cohort, even for screen-detected women. The impact of differential lifestyles, management and treatment warrant further investigation.},

However, very few studies have examined individual-level SES in relation to breast cancer survival or have assessed the contextual role of community-level SES independent of individual-level SES. The authors of this report examined both individual-level and community-level SES in relation to breast cancer survival in a population-based cohort of women ages 20 to 69 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer in Wisconsin between 1995 and 2003 (N = 5820). Compared with college graduates, women who had no education beyond high school were 1.39 times more likely (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.76) to die from breast cancer. Women who had household incomes <2.5 times the poverty level were 1.46 times more likely (95% CI, 1.10-1.92) to die from breast cancer than women who had household incomes ?5 times the poverty level. Adjusting the analysis for use of screening mammography, disease stage at diagnosis, and lifestyle factors eliminated the disparity by income, but the disparity by education persisted (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.99-1.61). In multilevel analyses, low community-level education was associated with increased breast cancer mortality even after adjusting for individual-level SES (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.09-2.27 for ?20% vs <10% of adults without a high school degree). The current results indicated that screening and early detection explain some of the disparity according to SES, but further research will be needed to understand the additional ways in which individual-level and community-level education are associated with survival.},

  abstract        = {This paper aims to describe socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer mortality in Europe and to get further insight into socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer mortality in different European populations by relating these to socioeconomic inequalities in overall mortality and smoking within the same or reference populations. Particular attention is paid to inequalities in Eastern European and Baltic countries. Data were obtained from mortality registers, population censuses and health interview surveys in 16 European populations. Educational inequalities in lung cancer and total mortality were assessed by direct standardization and calculation of two indices of inequality: the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII). SIIs were used to calculate the contribution of inequalities in lung cancer mortality to inequalities in total mortality. Indices of inequality in lung cancer mortality in the age group 40-59 years were compared with indices of inequalities in smoking taking into account a time lag of 20 years. The pattern of inequalities in Eastern European and Baltic countries is more or less similar as the one observed in the Northern countries. Among men educational inequalities are largest in the Eastern European and Baltic countries. Among women they are largest in Northern European countries. Whereas among Southern European women lung cancer mortality rates are still higher among the high educated, we observe a negative association between smoking and education among young female adults. The contribution of lung cancer mortality inequalities to total mortality inequalities is in most male populations more than 10%. Important smoking inequalities are observed among young adults in all populations. In Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic smoking inequalities among young adult women are larger than lung cancer mortality inequalities among women aged 20 years older. Important socioeconomic inequalities exist in lung cancer mortality in Europe. They are consistent with the geographical spread of the smoking epidemic. In the next decades socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer mortality are likely to persist and even increase among women. In Southern European countries we may expect a reversal from a positive to a negative association between socioeconomic status and lung cancer mortality. Continuous efforts are necessary to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in lung cancer mortality in all European countries.},

  abstract        = {Long-term recession of the Japanese economy during the 1990s led to growing social inequalities whilst health inequalities also appeared. The 2007 National Cancer Control Program of Japan targeted "equalisation of cancer medical services", but the system to monitor health inequalities was still inadequate. We aimed to measure socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival in Japan. We analysed 13 common invasive, primary, malignant tumours diagnosed from 1993 to 2004 and registered by the population-based Cancer Registry of Osaka Prefecture. An ecological socioeconomic deprivation index based on small area statistics, divided into quintile groups, was linked to patients according to their area of residence at the time of diagnosis. We estimated one-, five-year and conditional five-year net survival by sex, period of diagnosis (1993-1996/1997-2000/2001-2004) and deprivation group. Changes in survival over time, deprivation gap in survival, and change in deprivation gap were estimated at one and five years after diagnosis using variance-weighted least square regression. The deprivation gap in one-year net survival was narrower than in five-year net survival and conditional five-year survival. During the study period, there was no change in deprivation gap, except for reductions for pancreas (men) and stomach (women), and an increase for lung (men) in one-year survival. We observed a linear association between level of survival and deprivation gap at five years and conditional five years, but no association at one-year survival. A wide deprivation gap in survival was observed in most of the adult, solid, malignant tumours, within the universal healthcare system in Japan. Overall, cancer survival improved in Osaka without any widening of inequalities in cancer survival in 1993-2004, shortly after the long-term economic recession and deep modifications in the social and work environments in Japan. The longer term impact of the recession on inequalities in cancer survival needs to be monitored using population-based cancer registry data.},

  abstract        = {In long-term follow-up studies of survival after an initial event (eg, an operation) mortality from causes other than the one under study obscures the results, especially in elderly patients. In the traditional approach to the calculation of expected mortality a fictitious cohort is drawn from the general population, being matched for age, sex, and calendar time at the time of the initial event. The membership of this cohort is then kept constant from the initial event until the closing date of the study. The survival and mortality of this static cohort is then compared with that of the dynamic patient cohort to throw light on mortality from extraneous causes. This method can lead to severe bias if there is a strong correlation between the duration of observation of the patients and their age. The analysis can be improved by applying rate adjustment when calculating the background component of mortality. In this approach mortality rates from the general population are adjusted (weighted) so that the age, sex, and calendar year are at all times identical with those of each of the patients still alive and under observation. This is illustrated by means of a simplified example and a real-life one from a study at survival after aortic valve replacement. Estimation of rate-adjusted background mortality provides a framework that may put long-term survival, especially of elderly patients, in proper perspective.},

  abstract     = {We have previously reported that there is little evidence of population 'cure' among two populations of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. 'Cure' has not yet been examined in the context of screen-detection. We examined cancer registry data on 19 800 women aged 50-70, diagnosed with a primary, invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer between 1 April 1989 and 31 March 2011 in the West Midlands region of England, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and the National Breast Screening Service (NBSS). Follow-up was complete on all women up to 31 July 2012. Analyses were stratified by screening status, age, tumour stage, deprivation and ethnicity. We estimated net survival for the whole cohort and each subgroup. Population 'cure' was evaluated by fitting flexible parametric log-cumulative excess hazard regression models in which the excess hazard of breast cancer death was assumed to be equal to zero after a given follow-up time. There was an overall lack of evidence for 'cure'. Across all subgroups examined, the general pattern was that of a continuous decrease in net survival over time, with no obvious asymptotic tendency within 12 years of follow-up. Model-based analyses confirmed this observation. Despite dramatic improvements in survival over past decades, diagnosis with breast cancer remains associated with a small but persistent increased risk of death for all groups of women, including those whose cancer is detected asymptomatically. These findings are unlikely to be due to methodological inadequacies. Communication of these long-term consequences of breast cancer among women recently diagnosed and to those considering undergoing screening should take due consideration of these patterns.},

If claim-prone physicians account for a substantial share of all claims, the ability to reliably identify them at an early stage could guide efforts to improve care. Using data from the National Practitioner Data Bank, we analyzed 66,426 claims paid against 54,099 physicians from 2005 through 2014. We calculated concentrations of claims among physicians. We used multivariable recurrent-event survival analysis to identify characteristics of physicians at high risk for recurrent claims and to quantify risk levels over time. Approximately 1% of all physicians accounted for 32% of paid claims. Among physicians with paid claims, 84% incurred only one during the study period (accounting for 68% of all paid claims), 16% had at least two paid claims (accounting for 32% of the claims), and 4% had at least three paid claims (accounting for 12% of the claims). In adjusted analyses, the risk of recurrence increased with the number of previous paid claims. For example, as compared with physicians who had one previous paid claim, the 2160 physicians who had three paid claims had three times the risk of incurring another (hazard ratio, 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.84 to 3.41); this corresponded in absolute terms to a 24% chance (95% CI, 22 to 26) of another paid claim within 2 years. Risks of recurrence also varied widely according to specialty--for example, the risk among neurosurgeons was four times as great as the risk among psychiatrists. Over a recent 10-year period, a small number of physicians with distinctive characteristics accounted for a disproportionately large number of paid malpractice claims.},

  abstract        = {In multi-state models, the expected length of stay (ELOS) in a state is not a straightforward object to relate to covariates, and the traditional approach has instead been to construct regression models for the transition intensities and calculate ELOS from these. The disadvantage of this approach is that the effect of covariates on the intensities is not easily translated into the effect on ELOS, and it typically relies on the Markov assumption. We propose to use pseudo-observations to construct regression models for ELOS, thereby allowing a direct interpretation of covariate effects while at the same time avoiding the Markov assumption. For this approach, all we need is a non-parametric consistent estimator for ELOS. For every subject (and for every state of interest), a pseudo-observation is constructed, and they are then used as outcome variables in the regression model. We furthermore show how to construct longitudinal (pseudo-) data when combining the concept of pseudo-observations with landmarking. In doing so, covariates are allowed to be time-varying, and we can investigate potential time-varying effects of the covariates. The models can be fitted using generalized estimating equations, and dependence between observations on the same subject is handled by applying the sandwich estimator. The method is illustrated using data from the US Health and Retirement Study where the impact of socio-economic factors on ELOS in health and disability is explored. Finally, we investigate the performance of our approach under different degrees of left-truncation, non-Markovianity, and right-censoring by means of simulation.},

To improve understanding of the prognosis of patients and enable health care providers to assess and manage resources, we wish to jointly model disease progression, mortality and their relation with patient characteristics. We show how episodes of hospitalisation for disease-related events, obtained from administrative data, can be used as a surrogate for disease status. We propose flexible multi-state models for serial hospital admissions and death in HF patients, that are able to accommodate important features of disease progression, such as multiple ordered events and competing risks. Fully parametric and semi-parametric semi-Markov models are implemented using freely available software in R. The models were applied to a dataset from the administrative data bank of the Lombardia region in Northern Italy, which included 15,298 patients who had a first hospitalisation ending in 2006 and 4 years of follow-up thereafter. This provided estimates of the associations of age and gender with rates of hospital admission and length of stay in hospital, and estimates of the expected total time spent in hospital over five years. For example, older patients and men were readmitted more frequently, though the total time in hospital was roughly constant with age. We also discuss the relative merits of parametric and semi-parametric multi-state models, and model assessment and comparison.},

  abstract        = {The aim of this article is to propose several methods that allow to investigate how and whether the shape of the hazard ratio after an intermediate event depends on the waiting time to occurrence of this event and/or the sojourn time in this state. A simple multi-state model, the illness-death model, is used as a framework to investigate the occurrence of this intermediate event. Several approaches are shown and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. All these approaches are based on Cox regression. As different time-scales are used, these models go beyond Markov models. Different estimation methods for the transition hazards are presented. Additionally, time-varying covariates are included into the model using an approach based on fractional polynomials. The different methods of this article are then applied to a dataset consisting of four studies conducted by the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG). The occurrence of the first isolated locoregional recurrence (ILRR) is studied. The results contribute to the debate on the role of the ILRR with respect to the course of the breast cancer disease and the resulting prognosis. We have investigated different modelling strategies for the transition hazard after ILRR or in general after an intermediate event. Including time-dependent structures altered the resulting hazard functions considerably and it was shown that this time-dependent structure has to be taken into account in the case of our breast cancer dataset. The results indicate that an early recurrence increases the risk of death. A late ILRR increases the hazard function much less and after the successful removal of the second tumour the risk of death is almost the same as before the recurrence. With respect to distant disease, the appearance of the ILRR only slightly increases the risk of death if the recurrence was treated successfully. It is important to realize that there are several modelling strategies for the intermediate event and that each of these strategies has restrictions and may lead to different results. Especially in the medical literature considering breast cancer development, the time-dependency is often neglected in the statistical analyses. We show that the time-varying variables cannot be neglected in the case of ILRR and that fractional polynomials are a useful tool for finding the functional form of these time-varying variables.},

Cohort study. National Joint Registry. About 275,000 patient records. Hip arthroplasty procedures were linked to the time to any subsequent mortality or revision (implant failure). Flexible parametric survival analysis methods were used to analyse time to mortality and also time to revision. Comparisons between procedure groups were adjusted for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and complexity. As there were large baseline differences in the characteristics of patients receiving cemented, uncemented, or resurfacing procedures, unadjusted comparisons are inappropriate. Multivariable survival analyses identified a higher mortality rate for patients undergoing cemented compared with uncemented total hip replacement (adjusted hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.16); conversely, there was a lower revision rate with cemented procedures (0.53, 0.50 to 0.57). These translate to small predicted differences in population averaged absolute survival probability at all time points. For example, compared with the uncemented group, at eight years after surgery the predicted probability of death in the cemented group was 0.013 higher (0.007 to 0.019) and the predicted probability of revision was 0.015 lower (0.012 to 0.017). In multivariable analyses restricted to men, there was a higher mortality rate in the cemented group and the uncemented group compared with the Birmingham hip resurfacing group. In terms of revision, the Birmingham hip resurfacings had a similar revision rate to uncemented total hip replacements. Both uncemented total hip replacements and Birmingham hip resurfacings had a higher revision rate than cemented total hip replacements. There is a small but significant increased risk of revision with uncemented rather than cemented total hip replacement, and a small but significant increased risk of death with cemented procedures. It is not known whether these are causal relations or caused by residual confounding. Compared with uncemented and cemented total hip replacements, Birmingham hip resurfacing has a significantly lower risk of death in men of all ages. Previously, only adjusted analyses of hip implant revision rates have been used to recommend and justify use of cheaper cemented total hip implants. Our investigations additionally consider mortality rates and suggest a potentially higher mortality rate with cemented total hip replacements, which merits further investigation.},

Our objective was to define factors affecting treatment selection and resulting survival outcomes in the United States. We identified 20,600 patients treated with CMT or chemotherapy between 2003 and 2011 from the National Cancer Data Base. Factors affecting treatment selection were studied in a mixed-effects logistic model. Survival outcomes were compared using a propensity score analysis to account for indication bias. Only 49.5% of patients received CMT, and this proportion steadily declined between 2003 (59.4%) and 2011 (45.2%), particularly in younger patients. Apart from classical prognostic factors (age, stage, tumor location, histology, comorbidities), treatment selection was significantly influenced by sex, black race, distance to facility, and type of insurance. Uninsured patients had the lowest odds of receiving CMT. A significant random effect related to facility-specific treatment preference was also evident. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 89.6%, and relative survival (RS) was 94.3%. After adjustment for guarantee-time and indication biases, CMT was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.70) and RS (excess HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.54) than chemotherapy alone. This effect was without significant heterogeneity in subset analysis and was not sensitive to unobserved confounding. Socioeconomic factors affect selection of curative treatments in HL. Widespread abandonment of CMT beyond circumstances sanctioned by guidelines may affect survival. Further research should focus on developing strategies that minimize toxicity and access disparities without compromising survival.},

Typically in these trials, besides overall survival, also other endpoints such as locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis are of interest. Most commonly in these situations, Cox regression models are applied for each of these endpoints separately or to composite endpoints such as disease-free survival. These approaches however fail to give insight into what happens to a patient after a first event. We re-analyzed data of 2795 patients from a breast cancer trial (EORTC 10854) by applying a multi-state model, with local recurrence, distant metastasis, and both local recurrence and distant metastasis as transient states and death as absorbing state. We used an approach where the clock is reset on entry of a new state. The influence of prognostic factors on each of the transition rates is studied, as well as the influence of the time at which intermediate events occur. The estimated transition rates between the states in the model are used to obtain predictions for patients with a given history. Formulas are developed and illustrated for these prediction probabilities for the clock reset approach.},

Whether excess occurrence of neurodegenerative disease occurred among recipients of blood from a subset of donors was also investigated. As a positive control, transmission of chronic hepatitis before and after implementation of hepatitis C virus screening was assessed. Among included patients, 2.9% received a transfusion from a donor diagnosed with one of the studied neurodegenerative diseases. No evidence of transmission of any of these diseases was found, regardless of approach. The hazard ratio for dementia in recipients of blood from donors with dementia versus recipients of blood from healthy donors was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.09). Corresponding estimates for Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease were 0.99 (CI, 0.85 to 1.15) and 0.94 (CI, 0.78 to 1.14), respectively. Hepatitis transmission was detected before but not after implementation of hepatitis C virus screening. Observational study design, underascertainment of the outcome, and possible insufficient statistical power. The data provide no evidence for the transmission of neurodegenerative diseases and suggest that if transmission does occur, it is rare.

  abstract        = {The aim of this study was to assess the misclassification of cause of death for breast cancer cases, and to evaluate the differential misclassification between cases detected in an organized screening program and cases found in current clinical practice. All deaths occurring between 1999 and 2002 within breast cancer cases were linked to hospital discharge records. Death certificates and latest available hospital discharge notes were classified into various categories. We created a classification algorithm defining which combinations of categories (of death certificates and hospital discharge notes) suggested the probability of misclassification and the need for an in-depth diagnostic review. Questionable cases were reviewed by a team of experts in order to reach a consensus on cause of death. Based on our algorithmic classification and diagnostic review results, the agreement between original cause of death and that resulting from the assessment process was analyzed stratifying for every variable of interest. According to death certificates, breast cancer was the cause of death in 66.9% of subjects, and after assessment this figure changed to 65.7%. The misclassification rate was 4.3% and did not differ significantly between screen-detected (4.7%) and non-screen-detected (4.3%) cases. Higher misclassification rates in favor of false positivity (cause of death wrongly attributed to breast cancer in death certificates) was observed for subjects with multiple cancers (6.5% vs. 1.9%), with no admission in the year before death (4.6% vs. 2.4%) and with an unknown cancer stage (4.9% vs 2.4% or 2.3%). The cause of death misclassification rate is modest, causing a slight overestimate of deaths attributed to breast cancer, and is not affected by modality of diagnosis. The study confirmed the validity of using cause-specific mortality for service screening evaluation.},

Unlike solid organ transplantation, the clinical consequences of donor characteristics on recipients have not been evaluated in transfusion medicine. To analyze the association of RBC donor age and sex with the survival of transfusion recipients. We established a longitudinal cohort by linking data from a blood collection agency with clinical and administrative data at 4 academic hospitals. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to evaluate the risk of donor age and sex on transfusion recipient survival. Between October 25, 2006, and December 31, 2013, a total of 30?503 RBC transfusion recipients received 187?960 RBC transfusions from 80?755 unique blood donors. For recipients receiving an RBC unit from younger donors, the risk of death was increased compared with recipients receiving an RBC unit from a donor 40 to 49.9 years old (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10; P?<?.001 for donor age range 17-19.9 years and 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09; P?<?.001 for donor age range 20-29.9 years). Receiving an RBC transfusion from a female donor was associated with an 8% statistically significant increased risk of death compared with receiving an RBC transfusion from a male donor (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09; P?<?.001). Red blood cell transfusions from younger donors and from female donors were statistically significantly associated with increased mortality. These findings suggest that donor characteristics may affect RBC transfusion outcomes.},

Our aim was to investigate the possible risk of cancer transmission from blood donors to recipients through blood transfusion. We did a register-based retrospective cohort study of cancer incidence among patients who received blood from donors deemed to have a subclinical cancer at the time of donation. These precancerous donors were diagnosed with a cancer within 5 years of the donation. Data from all computerised blood bank registers in Sweden and Denmark gathered between 1968 and 2002 were merged into a common database. Demographic and medical data, including mortality and cancer incidence, were ascertained through linkages with nationwide, and essentially complete, population and health-care registers. The risk of cancer in exposed recipients relative to that in recipients who received blood from non-cancerous donors was estimated with multivariate Poisson regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Of the 354 094 transfusion recipients eligible for this analysis, 12,012 (3%) were exposed to blood products from precancerous donors. There was no excess risk of cancer overall (adjusted relative risk 1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.07) or in crude anatomical subsites among recipients of blood from precancerous donors compared with recipients of blood from non-cancerous donors. Our data provide no evidence that blood transfusions from precancerous blood donors are associated with increased risk of cancer among recipients compared with transfusions from non-cancerous donors.},

During follow-up, 12 and 107 cases of CLL occurred among the exposed and unexposed recipients, respectively, yielding a relative risk of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.71). Analyses using the entire database showed no evidence of CLL clustering among recipients of blood from individual donors. In conclusion, when donor MBL was approximated by subsequent donor CLL diagnosis, data from 2 countries' entire computerized transfusion experience over more than 30 years indicate that MBL/CLL transmission does not contribute importantly to recipient CLL risk.},

All analyses were conducted by using Cox proportional hazards regression. Regardless of the analytic approach, no association was found between the length of RBC storage and mortality. The difference in 30-day cumulative mortality between patients receiving blood stored for 30 to 42 days and those receiving blood stored for 10 to 19 days was -0.2% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.1%).

Consistent with previous randomized trials, this study found no association between the length of storage of transfused RBCs and patient mortality.

Furthermore, data on treatment were validated by record linkage to the Swedish Patient Register and The Prescribed Drug Register. NPCR captured 98% of Pca cases in the Cancer Register and the mean value for completeness of the 48 evaluated variables was 90% (range 64-100%). Timeliness increased substantially from 2008 to 2012 with 95% of cases reported within 12 months after diagnosis in 2012. NPCR complied with national and international coding routines. Overall, the agreement between original data and re-abstracted data from 731 charts was high. For example, the correlation between original and re-abstracted data was 1.00 for date of surgery, and 0.97 for serum levels of prostate specific antigen and exact agreement was 97% for Gleason score at biopsy, 83% for clinical local T stage and more than 95% of the androgen deprivation therapies registered in NPCR had a corresponding filled prescription.

In many situations, a terminating event such as death can happen during the follow-up period to preclude further occurrence of the recurrent events. Furthermore, the death time may be dependent on the recurrent event history. In this article we consider frailty proportional hazards models for the recurrent and terminal event processes. The dependence is modeled by conditioning on a shared frailty that is included in both hazard functions. Covariate effects can be taken into account in the model as well. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step. An analysis of hospitalization and death data for waitlisted dialysis patients is presented to illustrate the proposed methods. Methods to check the validity of the proposed model are also demonstrated. This model avoids the difficulties encountered in alternative approaches which attempt to specify a dependent joint distribution with marginal proportional hazards and yields an estimate of the degree of dependence.},

  abstract        = {A now common goal in medical research is to investigate the inter-relationships between a repeatedly measured biomarker, measured with error, and the time to an event of interest. This form of question can be tackled with a joint longitudinal-survival model, with the most common approach combining a longitudinal mixed effects model with a proportional hazards survival model, where the models are linked through shared random effects. In this article, we look at incorporating delayed entry (left truncation), which has received relatively little attention. The extension to delayed entry requires a second set of numerical integration, beyond that required in a standard joint model. We therefore implement two sets of fully adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with nested Gauss-Kronrod quadrature (to allow time-dependent association structures), conducted simultaneously, to evaluate the likelihood. We evaluate fully adaptive quadrature compared with previously proposed non-adaptive quadrature through a simulation study, showing substantial improvements, both in terms of minimising bias and reducing computation time. We further investigate, through simulation, the consequences of misspecifying the longitudinal trajectory and its impact on estimates of association. Our scenarios showed the current value association structure to be very robust, compared with the rate of change that we found to be highly sensitive showing that assuming a simpler trend when the truth is more complex can lead to substantial bias. With emphasis on flexible parametric approaches, we generalise previous models by proposing the use of polynomials or splines to capture the longitudinal trend and restricted cubic splines to model the baseline log hazard function. The methods are illustrated on a dataset of breast cancer patients, modelling mammographic density jointly with survival, where we show how to incorporate density measurements prior to the at-risk period, to make use of all the available information.

  abstract        = {In this paper we address two issues arising in multi-state models with covariates. The first issue deals with how to obtain parsimony in the modeling of the effect of covariates. The standard way of incorporating covariates in multi-state models is by considering the transitions as separate building blocks, and modeling the effect of covariates for each transition separately, usually through a proportional hazards model for the transition hazard. This typically leads to a large number of regression coefficients to be estimated, and there is a real danger of over-fitting, especially when transitions with few events are present. We extend the reduced-rank ideas, proposed earlier in the context of competing risks, to multi-state models, in order to deal with this issue. The second issue addressed in this paper was motivated by the wish to obtain standard errors of the regression coefficients of the reduced-rank model. We propose a model-based resampling technique, based on repeatedly sampling trajectories through the multi-state model. The same ideas are also used for the estimation of prediction probabilities in general multi-state models and associated standard errors. We use data from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation to illustrate our techniques.},

These regression analyses are the foundation for predictions of cause-specific cumulative incidence functions based on combining the estimated cause-specific hazard functions. However, in predictions arising from disease registries, where only subjects with disease enter the database, disease-related mortality may be more naturally modeled on the time since diagnosis time scale while death from other causes may be more naturally modeled on the age time scale. The single time scale methodology may be biased if an incorrect time scale is employed for one of the causes and an alternative methodology is not available. We propose inferences for the cumulative incidence function in which regression models for the cause-specific hazard functions may be specified on different time scales. Using the disease registry data, the analysis of other cause mortality on the age scale requires left truncating the event time at the age of disease diagnosis, complicating the analysis. In addition, standard Martingale theory is not applicable when combining regression models on different time scales. We establish that the covariate conditional predictions are consistent and asymptotically normal using empirical process techniques and propose consistent variance estimators for constructing confidence intervals. Simulation studies show that the proposed two time scales method performs well, outperforming the single time-scale predictions when the time scale is misspecified. The methods are illustrated with stage III colon cancer data obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of National Cancer Institute.},

  abstract     = {Net survival is the survival that would be observed if the only possible underlying cause of death was the disease under study. It can be estimated with either cause-specific or relative survival data settings, if the informative censoring is properly considered. However, net survival estimators are prone to specific biases related to the data setting itself. We examined which data setting was the most robust against violation of key assumptions (erroneous cause of death and inappropriate life tables). We identified 4285 women in the Geneva Cancer Registry, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung cancer and melanoma between 1981 and 1991ÃÂÃÂ and estimated net survival up to 20 years using cause-specific and relative survival settings. We used weights to tackle informative censoring in both settingsÃÂÃÂ and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of misclassification of cause of death in the cause-specific setting or of using inappropriate life tables on net survival estimates in the relative survival setting. For all the four cancers, net survival was highest when using the cause-specific setting and the absolute difference between the two estimators increased with time since diagnosis. The sensitivity analysis showed that (i) the use of different life tables did not compromise net survival estimation in the relative survival setting, whereas (ii) a small level of misclassification for the cause of death led to a large change in the net survival estimate in the cause-specific setting. The relative survival setting was more robust to the above assumptions violations and is therefore recommended for estimation of net survival.},

To obtain precise estimates of survival, full dates (day, month and year) rather than partial dates (month and year) are required. In some jurisdictions, however, cancer registries are constrained from providing full dates on the grounds of confidentiality. The bias resulting from the use of partial dates in the estimation and comparison of survival makes it impossible to determine precisely the differences in the risk of death from cancer between population groups or in successive calendar periods. Important operational arguments also exist against the use of incomplete dates for survival analysis, including increased workload for cancer registry staff and the introduction of avoidable complexity for quality control of survival data. Cancer survival is one of the most widely known outputs produced by population-based cancer registries, and it is a crucial metric for the comparative effectiveness of health services. The bodies that set data access guidelines must take a more balanced view of the risks and benefits of using full dates for the estimation of cancer survival.},

The most common approach to analysis involves fitting a Cox regression model including a treatment indicator, and basing inference on the large sample properties of the regression coefficient estimator. Despite the fact that treatment assignment is randomized, the hazard ratio is not a quantity which admits a causal interpretation in the case of unmodelled heterogeneity. This problem arises because the risk sets beyond the first event time are comprised of the subset of individuals who have not previously failed. The balance in the distribution of potential confounders between treatment arms is lost by this implicit conditioning, whether or not censoring is present. Thus while the Cox model may be used as a basis for valid tests of the null hypotheses of no treatment effect if robust variance estimates are used, modeling frameworks more compatible with causal reasoning may be preferrable in general for estimation.},

This article presents estimates of crude probabilities of death due to UCB and the expected loss of lifetime stratified for patient characteristics. In Norway, 10,332 patients were diagnosed with UCB between 2001 and 2010. The crude probabilities of death due to UCB were estimated, stratified by gender, age and TÃÂÃÂ stage, using flexible parametric survival models. Based on these models, the loss in expectation of lifetime due to UCB was also estimated for the different strata. There is large variation in the estimated crude probabilities of death due to UCB (from 0.03 to 0.76 within 10 years since diagnosis) depending on age, gender and T stage. Furthermore, the expected loss of life expectancy is more than a decade for younger patients with muscle-invasive UCB and between a few months and 5 years for nonmuscle-invasive UCB. The suggested framework leads to clinically relevant prognostic risk estimates for individual patients diagnosed with UCB and the consequence in terms of loss of lifetime expectation. The published probability tables can be used in clinical praxis for risk communication.},

In this tutorial article, we explain and demonstrate the basics of these models to a broader audience of professionals in health care, infection control, and hospital epidemiology. METHODS Using a publicly available data set from a cohort study of intensive care unit patients, we show how hospital infection data can be displayed and explored graphically and how simple formulas are derived under some simplified assumptions for illustrating the basic ideas behind multistate models. Only a few simply accessible values (event counts and patient days) and a pocket calculator are needed to reveal basic insights into cumulative risk and clinical outcomes of nosocomial infection in terms of mortality and length of stay. RESULTS We show how to use these values to perform basic multistate analyses in own data or to correct biased estimates in published data, as these values are often reported. We also show relationships between multistate-based hazard ratios and odds ratios, which are derived from the popular logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS No sophisticated statistical software is required to apply a basic multistate model and to avoid typical pitfalls such as time-dependent or competing-risks bias.

  abstract     = {Analysing the determinants and consequences of hospital-acquired infections involves the evaluation of large cohorts. Infected patients in the cohort are often rare for specific pathogens, because most of the patients admitted to the hospital are discharged or die without such an infection. Death and discharge are competing events to acquiring an infection, because these individuals are no longer at risk of getting a hospital-acquired infection. Therefore, the data is best analysed with an extended survival model - the extended illness-death model. A common problem in cohort studies is the costly collection of covariate values. In order to provide efficient use of data from infected as well as uninfected patients, we propose a tailored case-cohort approach for the extended illness-death model. The basic idea of the case-cohort design is to only use a random sample of the full cohort, referred to as subcohort, and all cases, namely the infected patients. Thus, covariate values are only obtained for a small part of the full cohort. The method is based on existing and established methods and is used to perform regression analysis in adapted Cox proportional hazards models. We propose estimation of all cause-specific cumulative hazards and transition probabilities in an extended illness-death model based on case-cohort sampling. As an example, we apply the methodology to infection with a specific pathogen using a large cohort from Spanish hospital data. The obtained results of the case-cohort design are compared with the results in the full cohort to investigate the performance of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The extended illness-death model is a useful tool to study the risks and consequences of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). The statistical quantities of interest are the transition-specific hazard rates and the transition probabilities as well as attributable mortality (AM) and the population-attributable fraction (PAF). In the most general case calculation of these expressions is mathematically complex. When assuming time-constant hazards calculation of the quantities of interest is facilitated. In this situation the transition probabilities can be expressed in closed mathematical forms. The estimators for AM and PAF can be easily derived from these forms. In this paper, we show how to explicitly calculate all the transition probabilities of an extended-illness model with constant hazards. Using a parametric model to estimate the time-constant transition specific hazard rates of a data example, the transition probabilities, AM and PAF can be directly calculated. With a publicly available data example, we show how the approach provides first insights into principle time-dynamics and data structure. Assuming constant hazards facilitates the understanding of multi-state processes. Even in a non-constant hazards setting, the approach is a helpful first step for a comprehensive investigation of complex data.},

  abstract        = {Exploration of the complex relationship between prognostic indicators such as tumor grade and size and clinical outcomes such as local recurrence and distant metastasis in patients with cancer is crucial to guide treatment decisions. However, in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, there are many gaps in our understanding of this relationship. Multistate analysis may help us in gaining a comprehensive understanding of risk factor-outcome relationships in soft tissue sarcoma, because this methodology can integrate multiple risk factors and clinical endpoints into a single statistical model. To our knowledge, no study of this kind has been performed before in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. We implemented a multistate model of localized soft tissue sarcoma to statistically evaluate the relationship among baseline risk factors, recurrence, and death in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma undergoing curative surgery. Between 1998 and 2015, our center treated 539 patients for localized soft tissue sarcoma with surgery as curative intent. Of those, 96 patients (18%) were not included in this single-center retrospective study owing to missing baseline histopathology data (n = 3), not yet observed followup (n = 80), or because a neoadjuvant treatment approach in the presence of synchronous distant metastasis was used (n = 13), leaving 443 patients (82%) for the current analysis, of which 40 were lost to followup during the first year after surgery. All patients had tumors of the stages I to III according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Stages. The median age of the patients was 62 years (range, 16-96 years), and 217 patients (49%) were female. Three hundred-forty-six patients (78%) had tumors of high grade (Grades 2 and 3), and 310 (70%) tumors were greater than 5 cm in maximum diameter. Patients who had died during the first year of followup were included in this analysis. Median followup for the 443 study patients was 6 years, with 84%, 52%, and 23% of patients being followed for more than 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The 15-year cumulative incidences of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and death from any cause, using a competing risk analysis, were 16% (95% CI, 11%-22%), 21% (95% CI, 17%-26%), and 55% (95% CI, 44%-67%), respectively. Wide resection with a margin of 1 mm was the preferred treatment for all patients, except for those with Grade 1 liposarcoma where a marginal resection was considered adequate. Multistate models were implemented with the mstate library in R. In multistate analysis, patients who experienced a local recurrence were more likely to have distant metastasis develop (hazard ratio [HR] = 8.4; 95% CI, 4.3-16.5; p < 0.001), and to die (HR = 3.4; 95% CI, 2.1-5.6; p < 0.001). The occurrence of distant metastasis was associated with a strong increase in the risk of death (HR = 12.6; 95% CI, 8.7-18.3; p < 0.001). Distant metastasis occurring after a long tumor-free interval was not associated with a more-favorable prognosis with respect to mortality than distant metastasis occurring early after surgery (estimated relative decrease in the adverse effect of distant metastasis on mortality for 1-year delay in the occurrence of distant metastasis = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7-1.1; p = 0.28). High-grade histology (Grades 2 and 3) was associated with a higher risk of overall recurrence (defined as a composite of local recurrence and distant metastasis, HR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.8-7.8; p = 0.0003) and a higher risk of death after recurrence developed (HR = 4.4; 95% CI, 1.1-18.2; p = 0.04). Finally, the multistate model predicted distinct outcome patterns depending on baseline covariates and how long a patient has remained free from recurrence after surgery. In patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma undergoing resection, the occurrence of local recurrence and distant metastasis contributes to a dramatically impaired long-term survival outcome. Local recurrences are a substantial risk factor for distant metastasis. Multistate modeling is a very powerful approach for analysis of sarcoma cohorts, and may be used in the future to obtain highly personalized, dynamic predictions of outcomes in patients with localized soft tissue sarcoma.

Therefore, we did a systematic review to identify similarities and dissimilarities of the Nordic Cancer Registries, which could possibly explain some of the differences in cancer incidence rates across these countries. We describe and compare here the core characteristics of each of the Nordic Cancer Registries: (i) data sources; (ii) registered disease entities and deviations from IARC multiple cancer coding rules; (iii) variables and related coding systems. Major changes over time are described and discussed. All Nordic Cancer Registries represent a high quality standard in terms of completeness and accuracy of the registered data. Even though the information in the Nordic Cancer Registries in general can be considered more similar than any other collection of data from five different countries, there are numerous differences in registration routines, classification systems and inclusion of some tumors. These differences are important to be aware of when comparing time trends in the Nordic countries.},

These expected rates are usually presented by age, sex and calendar year. In certain situations, stratification of expected rates by other factors is required to avoid potential bias if interest lies in quantifying measures by such factors, for example, socioeconomic status. If data on a population level are not available, information from a control population could be used to adjust expected rates. We present two approaches for adjusting expected mortality rates using information from a control population; a Poisson generalised linear model, and a flexible parametric survival model. We used a control group from BCBaSe, a Swedish register-based matched breast cancer cohort with diagnoses between 1992 and 2012, to illustrate the two methods using socioeconomic status as a risk factor of interest. Results showed that Poisson and flexible parametric survival approaches estimate similar adjusted mortality rates by socioeconomic status. Additional uncertainty involved in the methods to estimate stratified expected mortality rates described in this study can be accounted for using a parametric bootstrap, but may make little difference if using a large control population.},

  abstract        = {In the past two decades, an increasing number of nationwide, Swedish Healthcare Quality Registries (QRs) focusing on specific disorders have been initiated, mostly by physicians. Here, we describe the purpose, organization, variables, coverage and completeness of 103 Swedish QRs. From March to September 2013, we examined the 2012 applications of 103 QRs to the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) and also studied the annual reports from the same QRs. After initial data abstraction, the coordinator of each QR was contacted at least twice between June and October 2013 and asked to confirm the accuracy of the data retrieved from the applications and reports. About 60% of the QRs covered ?80% of their target population (completeness). Data recorded in Swedish QRs include aspects of disease management (diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment and lead times). In addition, some QRs retrieve data on self-reported quality of life (EQ5D, SF-36 and disease-specific measures), lifestyle (smoking) and general health status (World Health Organization performance status, body mass index and blood pressure). Detailed clinical data available in Swedish QRs complement information from government-administered registries and provide an important source not only for assessment and development of quality of care but also for research.},

  abstract        = {In 2011, WHO member states signed up to the 25?{\AA}?25 initiative, a plan to cut mortality due to non-communicable diseases by 25% by 2025. However, socioeconomic factors influencing non-communicable diseases have not been included in the plan. In this study, we aimed to compare the contribution of socioeconomic status to mortality and years-of-life-lost with that of the 25?{\AA}?25 conventional risk factors. We did a multicohort study and meta-analysis with individual-level data from 48 independent prospective cohort studies with information about socioeconomic status, indexed by occupational position, 25?{\AA}?25 risk factors (high alcohol intake, physical inactivity, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and mortality, for a total population of 1?751?479 (54% women) from seven high-income WHO member countries. We estimated the association of socioeconomic status and the 25?{\AA}?25 risk factors with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality by calculating minimally adjusted and mutually adjusted hazard ratios [HR] and 95% CIs. We also estimated the population attributable fraction and the years of life lost due to suboptimal risk factors. During 26ÃÂÃÂ·6 million person-years at risk (mean follow-up 13ÃÂÃÂ·3 years [SD 6ÃÂÃÂ·4 years]), 310?277 participants died. HR for the 25?{\AA}?25 risk factors and mortality varied between 1ÃÂÃÂ·04 (95% CI 0ÃÂÃÂ·98-1ÃÂÃÂ·11) for obesity in men and 2?ÃÂÃÂ·17 (2ÃÂÃÂ·06-2ÃÂÃÂ·29) for current smoking in men. Participants with low socioeconomic status had greater mortality compared with those with high socioeconomic status (HR 1ÃÂÃÂ·42, 95% CI 1ÃÂÃÂ·38-1ÃÂÃÂ·45 for men; 1ÃÂÃÂ·34, 1ÃÂÃÂ·28-1ÃÂÃÂ·39 for women); this association remained significant in mutually adjusted models that included the 25?{\AA}?25 factors (HR 1ÃÂÃÂ·26, 1ÃÂÃÂ·21-1ÃÂÃÂ·32, men and women combined). The population attributable fraction was highest for smoking, followed by physical inactivity then socioeconomic status. Low socioeconomic status was associated with a 2ÃÂÃÂ·1-year reduction in life expectancy between ages 40 and 85 years, the corresponding years-of-life-lost were 0ÃÂÃÂ·5 years for high alcohol intake, 0ÃÂÃÂ·7 years for obesity, 3ÃÂÃÂ·9 years for diabetes, 1ÃÂÃÂ·6 years for hypertension, 2ÃÂÃÂ·4 years for physical inactivity, and 4ÃÂÃÂ·8 years for current smoking. Socioeconomic circumstances, in addition to the 25?{\AA}?25 factors, should be targeted by local and global health strategies and health risk surveillance to reduce mortality.

However, no studies so far have presented current transfusion statistics on a population level for this patient group. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted that was based on the Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions Database (SCANDAT2), which includes data on all blood donations and transfusions in Sweden and Denmark since the 1960s. Incident cases of hematologic malignancies were identified in the Swedish Cancer Register between 2000 and 2010. Cases were divided into nine patient groups based on diagnosis. A total of 28,693 patients were included in the cohort. Overall, the transfusion pattern varied depending on diagnosis and age. Patients with aggressive and acute diagnoses generally received more transfusions with immediate decline in transfusion incidence after diagnosis, whereas chronic diagnoses generally maintained more stable, but lower, transfusion incidence. In general, patients with leukemia received more transfusions than patients with lymphoma, and patients with acute leukemia as well as patients that had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantations received the most transfusions. Within 2 years after diagnosis, patients with acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed at ages 0 to 65 years received on average between 30 to 40 red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions, respectively, corresponding to direct material costs close to 200,000 SEK (23,809 USD). Results from this population-based overview of blood use in hematologic malignancies showed high variability depending on diagnosis and age.},

  abstract        = {The hypothesis in this study was that anaemia prior to surgery and perioperative red blood cell transfusion increases the risk for recurrence and overall mortality in patients with stages I-III colorectal cancer after abdominal resection with curative intent. This is a Swedish single centre retrospective cohort study. Data on 496 consecutive radical abdominal resections stages I-III colorectal cancer performed at the Karolinska University Hospital 2007-2010 were extracted from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry. Data were linked to local laboratory and transfusion databases to identify preoperative anaemia and perioperative transfusion. Disease recurrence was validated by scrutiny of patient records. A total of 496 stages I-III colorectal cancer patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumour and patient characteristics were performed to assess risk for recurrence and overall mortality. Anaemia prior to surgery was associated with increased risk for overall mortality (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.2). There was no association between anaemia and risk for recurrence (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.97-2.6). Transfusion was not associated with increased risk of recurrence (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.3) or overall mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.7-1.6). Anaemia prior to colorectal cancer surgery was associated with increased risk for overall mortality while a no increased risk was seen for recurrence. Previous findings indicating an association between blood transfusion and increased risk for recurrence could not be confirmed.},

  abstract     = {A common goal in the analysis of the long-term survival related to a specific disease is to estimate a measure that is comparable between populations with different general population mortality. When cause of death is unavailable or unreliable, as for example in cancer registry studies, relative survival methodology is used-in addition to the mortality data of the patients, we use the data on the mortality of the general population. In this article, we focus on the marginal relative survival measure that summarizes the information about the disease-specific hazard. Under additional assumptions about latent times to death of each cause, this measure equals net survival. We propose a new approach to estimation based on pseudo-observations and derive two estimators of its variance. The properties of the new approach are assessed both theoretically and with simulations, showing practically no bias and a close to nominal coverage of the confidence intervals with the precise formula for the variance. The approximate formula for the variance has sufficiently good performance in large samples where the precise formula calculation becomes computationally intensive. Using bladder cancer data and simulations, we show that the behavior of the new approach is very close to that of the Pohar Perme estimator but has the important advantage of a simpler formula that does not require numerical integration and therefore lends itself more naturally to further extensions.},

The study cohort consisted of all people diagnosed with cancer in the period 1990-2000 and aged 15-89ÃÂÃÂ years (nÃÂÃÂ =ÃÂÃÂ 1,275,978), with mortality follow-up to 31 December 2010. Flexible parametric survival models incorporating background age-sex-year-specific population mortality rates were applied to generate the observed survival curves for all cancers combined and selected major cancer types. Predicted values of loss of life expectancy (LOLE) in years were generated and then averaged across calendar year and age group (15-49, 50-69 and 70-89ÃÂÃÂ years) or spread of disease (localized, regional, distant, unknown). The greatest LOLE burden was for lung cancer (14.3ÃÂÃÂ years per diagnosis) and lowest for melanoma (2.5ÃÂÃÂ years). There was a significant decrease in LOLE over time (-0.13ÃÂÃÂ LOLE per year) for all cancers combined. Decreases were also observed for female breast cancer (-0.21), prostate cancer (-0.17), colorectal cancer (-0.08), melanoma (-0.07) and stomach cancer (-0.02), with slight increases for lung cancer (+0.04). When restricted to the sub-cohort from New South Wales with spread of disease information, these decreases in LOLE were primarily among cancers categorized as localized or regional spread at diagnosis. In Australia, persons diagnosed with cancer have a steadily improving outlook that exceeds that expected by general improvement in population life expectancy. The overall improvement is observed in persons with localized or regional cancers but not in those with advanced cancers, findings which encourage earlier diagnosis.},

Assuming two latent categories of tumors, one of which is more prone to screen detection and correspondingly less prone to death from the cancer in question, the authors have developed a strategy of sensitivity analysis for various magnitudes of length bias. Here they demonstrate these methods using a series of 25,962 breast cancer cases (1988-2004) from the West Midlands, United Kingdom.},

  abstract        = {We set out to estimate net survival trends for 10 common cancers in 279 cancer registry populations in 67 countries around the world, as part of the CONCORD-2 study. Net survival can be interpreted as the proportion of cancer patients who survive up to a given time, after eliminating the impact of mortality from other causes (background mortality). Background mortality varies widely between populations and over time. It was therefore necessary to construct robust life tables that accurately reflected the background mortality in each of the registry populations. Life tables of all-cause mortality rates by single year of age and sex were constructed by calendar year for each population and, when possible, by racial or ethnic sub-groups. We used three different approaches, based on the type of mortality data available from each registry. With death and population counts, we adopted a flexible multivariable modelling approach. With unsmoothed mortality rates, we used the Ewbank relational method. Where no data were available from the registry or a national statistical office, we used the abridged UN Population Division life tables and interpolated these using the Elandt-Johnson method. We also investigated the impact of using state- and race-specific life tables versus national race-specific life tables on estimates of net survival from four adult cancers in the United StatesÃÂÃÂ (US). We constructed 6,514 life tables covering 327 populations. Wide variations in life expectancy at birth and mortality by age were observed, even within countries. During 1995-99, life expectancy was lowest in Nigeria and highest in Japan, ranging from 47 to 84ÃÂÃÂ years among females and 46 to 78ÃÂÃÂ years among males. During 2005-09, life expectancy was lowest in Lesotho and again highest in Japan, ranging from 45 to 86ÃÂÃÂ years among females and 45 to 80ÃÂÃÂ years among males. For the US, estimates of net survival differed by up to 4% if background mortality was fully controlled with state- and race-specific life tables, rather than with national race-specific life tables. Background mortality varies worldwide. This emphasises the importance of using population-specific life tables for geographic and international comparisons of net survival.},

We propose to report variation in survival explained by each variable that constitutes these models. We adapted the ranks explained (RE) measure to the relative survival data setting, ie, when competing risks of death are accounted for through life tables from the general population. RE is calculated at each event time. We introduce weights for each death reflecting its probability to be a cancer death. RE varies between -1 and +1 and can be reported at given times in the follow-up and as a time-varying measure from diagnosis onward. We present an application for patients diagnosed with colon or lung cancer in England. The RE measure shows reasonable properties and is comparable in both relative and cause-specific settings. One year after diagnosis, RE for the most complex excess hazard models reaches 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.58 (0.58 95% CI: 0.56-0.60) and 0.69, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.70 (0.67, 95% CI: 0.66-0.69) for lung and colon cancer men (women), respectively. Stage at diagnosis accounts for 12.4% (10.8%) of the overall variation in survival among lung cancer patients whereas it carries 61.8% (53.5%) of the survival variation in colon cancer patients. Variables other than performance status for lung cancer (10%) contribute very little to the overall explained variation. The proportion of the variation in survival explained by key prognostic factors is a crucial information toward understanding the mechanisms underpinning cancer survival. The time-varying RE provides insights into patterns of influence for strong predictors.},

A total of 42,646 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1992 and 2008 were identified in two Clinical Quality Registers in Central Sweden. Breast cancer-specific, conditional breast cancer, competing-cause and all-cause mortality were estimated in relation to comorbidity burden assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index. All analyses were stratified by stage at diagnosis using competing risk analyses, and all-cause mortality was estimated as a function of follow-up time. Following adjustment for age and calendar period, breast conserving surgery was significantly less likely to be offered to women with severe comorbidity (OR 0.63; 95 % CI 0.58-0.69). Similarly, the proportion treated with radiotherapy, tamoxifen, or chemotherapy was lower in women with severe compared to those with no comorbidity. In women with early stage disease, breast cancer-specific mortality was higher among patients with severe comorbidity (sHR 1.47; 95 % CI 1.11-1.94). In all stages of breast cancer, conditional breast cancer and competing-cause mortality were elevated in women with severe comorbidity. For all stages, the relative risk of all-cause mortality between women with severe versus no comorbidity varied by time since diagnosis, and was most pronounced at early follow-up. Comorbidity affects treatment decisions and mortality. In women with early stage breast cancer, severe comorbidity was associated not only with conditional breast cancer, competing-cause and all-cause mortality, but also breast cancer-specific mortality. The observed differences in breast cancer-specific mortality may be due to less extensive treatment, impaired tumor defense and differences in general health status and lifestyle factors.},

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of breast cancer treatment on mortality, taking age at diagnosis and comorbidity into account. Four nationwide population registries in Denmark: the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, the Danish National Patient Register, and the Danish Register of Causes of Death provided information on 62 591 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, 1990-2008, of whom data on treatment were available for 39 943. Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Adjuvant treatment were categorised as none, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and unknown. Multivariable Cox modelling assessed the effect of comorbidity on breast cancer-specific mortality and other cause mortality according to treatment, adjusting for age at diagnosis and other clinical prognostic factors. The impact of comorbidity on mortality was most pronounced in patients aged 50-79 years. Patients receiving chemotherapy with mild to moderate comorbidity had HR 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI); 0.82-1.19) and 1.06 (95% CI; 0.77-1.46) for breast cancer-specific mortality, respectively, compared with patients without comorbidity. Comorbidity at breast cancer diagnosis is an independent adverse prognostic factor for death after breast cancer. We identified a subgroup of patients with mild to moderate comorbidity receiving chemotherapy who had similar breast cancer mortality as patients with no comorbidity.},

Distinguishing these measures and how they should be interpreted has led to confusion among scientists, the media, health care professionals and patients. This motivates the development of tools to facilitate communication and interpretation of these statistics. "InterPreT Cancer Survival" is a newly developed, publicly available, online interactive cancer survival tool targeted towards health-care professionals and epidemiologists (http://interpret.le.ac.uk). It focuses on the correct interpretation of commonly reported cancer survival measures facilitated through the use of dynamic interactive graphics. Statistics presented are based on parameter estimates obtained from flexible parametric relative survival models using large population-based English registry data containing information on survival across 6 cancer sites; Breast, Colon, Rectum, Stomach, Melanoma and Lung. Through interactivity, the tool improves understanding of various measures and how survival or mortality may vary by age and sex. Routine measures of cancer survival are reported, however, individualised estimates using crude probabilities are advocated, which is more appropriate for patients or health care professionals. The results are presented in various interactive formats facilitating understanding of individual risk and differences between various measures. "InterPreT Cancer Survival" is presented as an educational tool which engages the user through interactive features to improve the understanding of commonly reported cancer survival statistics. The tool has received positive feedback from a Cancer Research UK patient sounding board and there are further plans to incorporate more disease characteristics, e.g. stage.},

  abstract     = {Purpose With excellent cure rates for young patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), there is an increasing number of female survivors of HL interested in becoming pregnant. Here, we report childbearing among contemporarily treated HL survivors in comparison with the general population. Material and Methods Using Swedish registers, 449 women (ages 18 to 40 years) diagnosed with HL between 1992 and 2009 and in remission 9 months after diagnosis were identified. Patients were age- and calendar-year-matched to 2,210 population comparators. Rates of first postdiagnosis childbirth were calculated. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for different follow-up periods using Cox regression. Cumulative probabilities of first childbirth were calculated in the presence of the competing risk of death or relapse. Results Twenty-two percent of relapse-free patients with HL had a child during follow-up, and first childbirth rates increased over time, from 40.2 per 1,000 person-years (1992 to 1997) to 69.7 per 1,000 person-years (2004 to 2009). For comparators, childbirth rates remained stable (70.1 per 1,000 person-years). Patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 had a cumulative probability of childbirth similar to comparators. Three years or more after diagnosis, no differences in childbirth rates were observed between patients and comparators, regardless of stage or treatment. Patients who received six to eight courses of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone had a lower childbirth rate than comparators during the first 3 years (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.94), as did patients who received six to eight courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.65). Conclusion Childbearing potential among female survivors of HL has improved over time, and childbirth rates 3 years after diagnosis in contemporarily treated patients are, in the absence of relapse, similar to those in the general population, regardless of stage and treatment.},

The reliability of estimates are assessed using English data for 10 cancer types and the use of online interactive graphs to enable a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis at the control of the user is demonstrated. Sixty FPMs were fitted to each cancer type with varying degrees of freedom to model the baseline excess hazard and the main and time-dependent effect of age. For each model, we obtained age-specific, age-group and internally age-standardised relative survival estimates. The Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion were also calculated and comparative estimates were obtained using the Ederer II and Pohar Perme methods. Web-based interactive graphs were developed to present results. Age-standardised estimates were very insensitive to the exact number of knots for the splines. Age-group survival is also stable with negligible differences between models. Age-specific estimates are less stable especially for the youngest and oldest patients, of whom there are very few, but for most scenarios perform well. Although estimates do not depend heavily on the number of knots, too few knots should be avoided, as they can result in a poor fit. Interactive graphs engage researchers in assessing model sensitivity to a wide range of scenarios and their use is highly encouraged.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer can negatively influence working life, but it is unclear how many working years women with breast cancer can expect to lose. Women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1997 and 2012 were identified in the Breast Cancer Data Base Sweden (N=19,661), together with breast cancer-free comparison women (N=81ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ303). Using flexible parametric survival modelling, the loss in working years was calculated as the difference in the remaining years in the work force between women with and without breast cancer. Women aged 50 years at diagnosis with stage I disease lost on average 0.5 years (95% CI, 0.2-0.7) of their remaining working time; the corresponding estimates were 0.9 years (0.5-1.2) in stage II, 2.5 years (1.9-3.1) in stage III and 8.1 years (6.5-9.7) in stage IV. Women with in situ breast cancer did not lose any working years. The strongest treatment determinant was axillary lymph node dissection. We found a loss in working years not only in late but also in early-stage breast cancer. Although it is reassuring that some groups had no or only a modest work loss, the economic consequences for society are considerable given the large number of women annually diagnosed with breast cancer.},

  abstract     = {When patients randomised to the control group of a randomised controlled trial are allowed to switch onto the experimental treatment, intention-to-treat analyses of the treatment effect are confounded because the separation of randomised groups is lost. Previous research has investigated statistical methods that aim to estimate the treatment effect that would have been observed had this treatment switching not occurred and has demonstrated their performance in a limited set of scenarios. Here, we investigate these methods in a new range of realistic scenarios, allowing conclusions to be made based upon a broader evidence base. We simulated randomised controlled trials incorporating prognosis-related treatment switching and investigated the impact of sample size, reduced switching proportions, disease severity, and alternative data-generating models on the performance of adjustment methods, assessed through a comparison of bias, mean squared error, and coverage, related to the estimation of true restricted mean survival in the absence of switching in the control group. Rank preserving structural failure time models, inverse probability of censoring weights, and two-stage methods consistently produced less bias than the intention-to-treat analysis. The switching proportion was confirmed to be a key determinant of bias: sample size and censoring proportion were relatively less important. It is critical to determine the size of the treatment effect in terms of an acceleration factor (rather than a hazard ratio) to provide information on the likely bias associated with rank-preserving structural failure time model adjustments. In general, inverse probability of censoring weight methods are more volatile than other adjustment methods.},

This approach is widely believed to be problematic due to the nonlinearity of some exposure-effect measures. When the expected value of the outcome is modeled as a nonlinear function of the exposure, the adjusted and unadjusted exposure effects can differ even in the absence of confounding (Greenland , Robins, and Pearl, 1999); we call this the nonlinearity effect. In this paper, we propose a corrected measure of confounding that does not include the nonlinearity effect. The performances of the simple and corrected estimates of confounding are assessed in simulations and illustrated using a study of risk factors for low birth-weight infants. We conclude that the simple estimate of confounding is adequate or even preferred in settings where the nonlinearity effect is very small. In settings with a sizable nonlinearity effect, the corrected estimate of confounding has improved performance.}}

  abstract        = {Large international differences in colorectal cancer survival exist, even between countries with similar healthcare. We investigate the extent to which stage at diagnosis explains these differences. Data from population-based cancer registries in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the UK were analysed for 313 852 patients diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer during 2000-2007. We compared the distributions of stage at diagnosis. We estimated both stage-specific net survival and the excess hazard of death up to three years after diagnosis, using flexible parametric models on the log-cumulative excess hazard scale. International differences in colon and rectal cancer stage distributions were wide: Denmark showed a distribution skewed towards later-stage disease, while Australia, Norway and the UK showed high proportions of 'regional' disease. One-year colon cancer survival was 67% in the UK and ranged between 71% (Denmark) and 80% (Australia and Sweden) elsewhere. For rectal cancer, one-year survival was also low in the UK (75%), compared to 79% in Denmark and 82-84% elsewhere. International survival differences were also evident for each stage of disease, with the UK showing consistently lowest survival at one and three years. Differences in stage at diagnosis partly explain international differences in colorectal cancer survival, with a more adverse stage distribution contributing to comparatively low survival in Denmark. Differences in stage distribution could arise because of differences in diagnostic delay and awareness of symptoms, or in the thoroughness of staging procedures. Nevertheless, survival differences also exist for each stage of disease, suggesting unequal access to optimal treatment, particularly in the UK.},

  abstract        = {Substantial socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer survival persist in England, possibly due to more advanced cancer at diagnosis and differential access to treatment. We aim to disentangle the contributions of differential stage at diagnosis and differential treatment to the socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival. Information on 36,793 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 2000-2007 was routinely collected by an English population-based cancer registry. Deprivation was determined for each patient according to her area of residence at the time of diagnosis. A parametric implementation of the mediation formula using Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the proportion of the effect of deprivation on survival mediated by stage and by treatment. One-third (35ÃÂÃÂ % [23-48ÃÂÃÂ %]) of the higher mortality experienced by most deprived patients at 6ÃÂÃÂ months after diagnosis, and one tenth (14ÃÂÃÂ % [-3 to 31ÃÂÃÂ %]) at 5ÃÂÃÂ years, was mediated by adverse stage distribution. We initially found no evidence of mediation via differential surgical treatment. However, sensitivity analyses testing some of our study limitations showed in particular that up to thirty per cent of the higher mortality in most deprived patients could be mediated by differential surgical treatment. This study illustrates the importance of using causal inference methods with routine medical data and the need for testing key assumptions through sensitivity analyses. Our results suggest that, although effort for earlier diagnosis is important, this would reduce the cancer survival inequalities only by a third. Because of data limitations, role of differential surgical treatment may have been under-estimated.},

Multi-state Markov models have been widely used, but several research groups have proposed other modelling frameworks based on specifying an underlying biological continuous tumour growth process. These continuous models offer some advantages over multi-state models and have been used, for example, to quantify screening sensitivity in terms of mammographic density, and to quantify the effect of body size covariates on tumour growth and time to symptomatic detection. As of yet, however, the continuous tumour growth models are not sufficiently developed and require extensive computing to obtain parameter estimates. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the underlying assumptions of the continuous tumour growth model, derive new theoretical results for the model, and show how these results may help the development of this modelling framework. In illustrating the approach, we develop a model for mammography screening sensitivity, using a sample of 1901 post-menopausal women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.},

We also described gender-specific differences in survival for patients with bladder cancer and estimated to what extent they can be explained by differences in T-stage distribution at the first diagnosis. The present study comprised all 15,129 new cases of histologically verified invasive and non-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder diagnosed between 1997 and 2011 as registered in the Cancer Registry of Norway. Gender-specific excess mortality risk rates and risk ratios were calculated based on a flexible parametric relative survival model adjusting for T-stage and age, allowing the effect of gender to vary over time. We also present gender-specific relative survival curves for different T-stage patterns adjusted for age. Risk rates were significantly higher for women than men up to 2 years after bladder cancer diagnosis, particularly for muscle-invasive cancers. Thereafter, risk rates appeared to be higher in men. Adverse T-Stage distribution in women explained half of the unfavourable survival difference in female patients 2 years after diagnosis. The common view of worse bladder cancer prognosis in women than in men needs to be revised. Norwegian women have a less favourable prognosis solely within the first 2 years after diagnosis, particularly when diagnosed with a muscle-invasive tumour; parts of this discrepancy can be attributed to more severe initial diagnoses in women.},

  abstract    = {This study was undertaken to determine the best time during the menstrual cycle to perform dynamic breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The contralateral "normal" breast of 50 premenopausal women (mean age 40.4 +/- 6.4 years, range 30--52 years) were enrolled in a protocol designed to correlate an ipsilateral suspicious breast lesion with pathology. The contralateral breast in each patient was examined with palpation and mammography prior to MRI on a 1.5 T scanner using gradient echo and dynamic contrast-enhanced echo-planar without and following gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) injection. Pre-contrast T1 relaxation times were measured before calculating extraction flow product (EFP) maps using a multicompartmental model. T1, EFP, and enhancement were measured in the control breast on four slices centered around the nipple and recorded as a function of the phases of the menstrual cycle. Lesions or areas with focal enhancement were excluded. Analysis of variance and Fisher's tests were performed. The cyclic changes in T1 relaxation time were not significant (p>0.2). EFP and enhancement varied significantly during the cycle (p<0.003 and p<0.004, respectively), with low values during the first half of the cycle and high values during the second half. The lowest values of EFP and enhancement (5.5+/-2.9 ml/100 g/min and 26+/-17\%) were observed during the proliferative phase (days 3--7), and the highest values (17+/-10.2 ml/100 g/min and 104+/-28\%) were observed during the secretory phase (days 21-27) (p<0.0006 and p<0.0008, respectively). Dynamic breast MRI should be performed during first half of the menstrual cycle (days 3--14) in order to minimize interpretative difficulties related to the uptake of gadolinium in normal breast tissue due to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle.},

To estimate the number of persons alive who have a history of cancer, we derived prevalence rates based on data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry.

In 1982 the age-adjusted prevalence rates of cancer among males and females were 1,789 and 2,222, respectively, per 100,000. Age-specific prevalence rates were highest among the elderly; 12 percent of men and 11 percent of women over 70 had previously been given a diagnosis of cancer. Breast cancer in females and prostate cancer in males were the two most prevalent malignant diseases. We estimate that about 5 million persons alive in the United States today have at one time received a diagnosis of cancer.},

  abstract    = {Cancers arise from multiple acquired mutations, which presumably occur over many years. Early stages in cancer development might be present years before cancers become clinically apparent.We analyzed data from whole-exome sequencing of DNA in peripheral-blood cells from 12,380 persons, unselected for cancer or hematologic phenotypes. We identified somatic mutations on the basis of unusual allelic fractions. We used data from Swedish national patient registers to follow health outcomes for 2 to 7 years after DNA sampling.Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations was observed in 10\% of persons older than 65 years of age but in only 1\% of those younger than 50 years of age. Detectable clonal expansions most frequently involved somatic mutations in three genes (DNMT3A, ASXL1, and TET2) that have previously been implicated in hematologic cancers. Clonal hematopoiesis was a strong risk factor for subsequent hematologic cancer (hazard ratio, 12.9; 95\% confidence interval, 5.8 to 28.7). Approximately 42\% of hematologic cancers in this cohort arose in persons who had clonality at the time of DNA sampling, more than 6 months before a first diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens obtained from two patients at the time of diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia revealed that their cancers arose from the earlier clones.Clonal hematopoiesis with somatic mutations is readily detected by means of DNA sequencing, is increasingly common as people age, and is associated with increased risks of hematologic cancer and death. A subset of the genes that are mutated in patients with myeloid cancers is frequently mutated in apparently healthy persons; these mutations may represent characteristic early events in the development of hematologic cancers.

  abstract    = {To investigate whether mammographic breast densities and the respective degree of MRI background enhancement would correlate. Mammographic breast density is coded to communicate how likely a cancer is obscured by parenchyma. Similarly, background enhancement in breast MRI could obscure enhancing cancer tissue.A total of 468 women underwent standard full-field digital mammography and dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI in our institution. Mammographic breast density was scored according to the American College of Radiology-classification; background enhancement in MRI was scored on a 4-point scale from absent to severe. Breast "density classes" were retrospectively compared by analyzing the differences between scores for mammography and MRI. Statistical correlation was calculated using the Spearman coefficient.Scores matched in 19\% of women (90/468) but differed in 81\% (378/468). A deviation by 1 point was observed in 33\% (157/468), by 2 points in 38\% (179/468), by 3 in 9\% (42/468). Scores for background enhancement were lower than mammographic scores in 371/468 (79.3\%), equivalent in 90/468 (19.2\%), and higher in 7/468 (1.5\%).Mammographic breast density does not correlate with the degree of background enhancement in MRI. In the majority of women, scores for background enhancement in MRI will be lower than the respective mammographic density scores.},

  abstract    = {Converging evidence indicates that women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) have increased mortality compared to women with breast cancer not diagnosed near pregnancy (non-PABC). Our aim was to investigate if the stage distribution differs between PABC and non-PABC and if stage at diagnosis can explain the poorer prognosis observed among women with PABC. We identified 3,282 breast cancers in women aged 15-44 years at diagnosis for whom staging data (tumor size, nodal involvement, metastasis) were available in the Swedish Cancer Register between 2002 and 2009. Information on reproductive history and vital status was obtained from the Multi-Generation Register and the Cause of Death Register. PABC was defined as breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy and up to 2 years after delivery (n = 317). Non-PABC was defined as cases diagnosed before pregnancy or more than 2 years postpartum. Stage distributions were compared between PABC and non-PABC, and mortality rates were modeled using Cox regression. Compared to women with non-PABC, the mortality was almost 50 \% higher in women with PABC [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.47 (95 \% CI 1.04-2.08)], a difference which was reduced after adjustment for age and calendar year of diagnosis [HR 1.27 (95 \% CI 0.88-1.83)]. Although advanced stage of breast cancer at diagnosis was more common among PABC than among non-PABC, further adjustment for stage only slightly reduced the HR [1.22 (95 \% CI 0.84-1.78)]. The difference in mortality between PABC and non-PABC was more pronounced among women above 35 years and among women with PABC diagnosed within 1 year postpartum. Age, rather than stage at diagnosis, appears to act as the principal driver of the increased mortality observed in women with PABC. However, these findings do not preclude an untoward influence on mortality by pregnancy-associated factors affecting tumor aggressiveness and progression.},

The authors evaluated changes in the number of enhancing foci and the respective enhancement patterns within a cycle and between cycles.Both diffuse and nodular enhancement of breast parenchyma occurred during all phases of the menstrual cycle, especially in weeks 1 and 4. Enhancement was lowest in week 2. A total of 60 enhancing foci (73\% of which resolved completely during follow-up) were found in 16 of 20 volunteers. Twenty-six foci demonstrated enhancement velocities beyond the malignancy threshold (>80\% increase in the 1st minute).Contrast-enhancing foci are normal in healthy premenopausal breasts, even when formal malignancy criteria of enhancement velocity are met. This has to be kept in mind to avoid false-positive results, especially in younger patients.},

  abstract    = {We investigated whether an abbreviated protocol (AP), consisting of only one pre- and one postcontrast acquisition and their derived images (first postcontrast subtracted [FAST] and maximum-intensity projection [MIP] images), was suitable for breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening.We conducted a prospective observational reader study in 443 women at mildly to moderately increased risk who underwent 606 screening MRIs. Eligible women had normal or benign digital mammograms and, for those with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts (n = 427), normal or benign ultrasounds. Expert radiologists reviewed the MIP image first to search for significant enhancement and then reviewed the complete AP (consisting of MIP and FAST images and optionally their nonsubtracted source images) to characterize enhancement and establish a diagnosis. Only thereafter was the regular full diagnostic protocol (FDP) analyzed.MRI acquisition time for FDP was 17 minutes, versus 3 minutes for the AP. Average time to read the single MIP and complete AP was 2.8 and 28 seconds, respectively. Eleven breast cancers (four ductal carcinomas in situ and seven invasive cancers; all T1N0 intermediate or high grade) were diagnosed, for an additional cancer yield of 18.2 per 1,000. MIP readings were positive in 10 (90.9\%) of 11 cancers and allowed establishment of the absence of breast cancer, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8\% (418 of 419). Interpretation of the complete AP, as with the FDP, allowed diagnosis of all cancers (11 [100\%] of 11). Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of AP versus FDP were equivalent (94.3\% v 93.9\% and 24.4\% v 23.4\%, respectively).An MRI acquisition time of 3 minutes and an expert radiologist MIP image reading time of 3 seconds are sufficient to establish the absence of breast cancer, with an NPV of 99.8\%. With a reading time < 30 seconds for the complete AP, diagnostic accuracy was equivalent to that of the FDP and resulted in an additional cancer yield of 18.2 per 1,000.},

We used random-effects models to calculate pooled odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). All tests were two-sided with P less than .05 considered to be statistically significant.Among premenopausal women (n = 1776 case patients; n = 2834 control subjects), summary odds ratios were 1.37 (95\% CI = 1.29 to 1.47) for absolute dense area, 0.78 (95\% CI = 0.71 to 0.86) for absolute nondense area, and 1.52 (95\% CI = 1.39 to 1.66) for percentage dense area when pooling estimates adjusted for age, body mass index, and parity. Corresponding odds ratios among postmenopausal women (n = 6643 case patients; n = 11187 control subjects) were 1.38 (95\% CI = 1.31 to 1.44), 0.79 (95\% CI = 0.73 to 0.85), and 1.53 (95\% CI = 1.44 to 1.64). After additional adjustment for absolute dense area, associations between absolute nondense area and breast cancer became attenuated or null in several studies and summary odds ratios became 0.82 (95\% CI = 0.71 to 0.94; P heterogeneity = .02) for premenopausal and 0.85 (95\% CI = 0.75 to 0.96; P heterogeneity < .01) for postmenopausal women.The results suggest that percentage dense area is a stronger breast cancer risk factor than absolute dense area. Absolute nondense area was inversely associated with breast cancer risk, but it is unclear whether the association is independent of absolute dense area.},

	How relative and absolute risk of distant metastasis varies over

	under the age of 75 when diagnosed with breast cancer in Stockholm

	and presented as hazard ratio (HR) and cumulative risk.A total of
	995 (10.4\%) patients developed distant metastasis; the most common

  abstract    = {An Individual Patient Data (IPD) meta-analysis is often considered
	the gold-standard for synthesising survival data from clinical trials.
	An IPD meta-analysis can be achieved by either a two-stage or a one-stage
	approach, depending on whether the trials are analysed separately
	or simultaneously. A range of one-stage hierarchical Cox models have
	been previously proposed, but these are known to be computationally
	intensive and are not currently available in all standard statistical
	software. We describe an alternative approach using Poisson based
	Generalised Linear Models (GLMs).We illustrate, through application
	and simulation, the Poisson approach both classically and in a Bayesian
	framework, in two-stage and one-stage approaches. We outline the
	benefits of our one-stage approach through extension to modelling
	treatment-covariate interactions and non-proportional hazards. Ten
	trials of hypertension treatment, with all-cause death the outcome
	of interest, are used to apply and assess the approach.We show that
	the Poisson approach obtains almost identical estimates to the Cox
	model, is additionally computationally efficient and directly estimates
	the baseline hazard. Some downward bias is observed in classical
	estimates of the heterogeneity in the treatment effect, with improved
	performance from the Bayesian approach.Our approach provides a highly
	flexible and computationally efficient framework, available in all
	standard statistical software, to the investigation of not only heterogeneity,
	but the presence of non-proportional hazards and treatment effect
	modifiers.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: Relative survival is a method of analysis of failure-time
	data used to estimate the net survival. Cancer registries frequently
	use this method. The main regressive models are the Hakulinen and
	Tenkanen model, and the Esteve et al. model, which are easily used
	in practice thanks to their specific software (SURV and RELSURV,
	respectively). An assessment of the behaviour of the models is made,
	with the aim of giving advice for users of lifetime data in practice.
	METHODS: Simulations were done by respecting, then violating, the
	basic hypothesis supporting the theoretical foundation of these two
	proportional hazard models (independence of the death and censor
	process, proportionality of risks). For each simulation, 100 files
	of either 100, 1,000, or 10,000 individuals were generated to assess
	the behaviour of the model. RESULTS: Moderate censor rates, with
	or without proportionality assumption, lead to the use of the Hakulinen
	and Tenkanen model, especially for studies with little information.
	Non-proportionality of risks in the Hakulinen and Tenkanen model
	could be tested and analysed. If assumptions underlying the models
	are respected, the Esteve et al. model seems to be more precise.
	DISCUSSION: The choice of a model in practice depends on its performance,
	and on the user's knowledge of statistics and computer science. Non-proportionality
	of risks is common in cancer registries. In theory, non-proportionality
	of risks could be taken into account for both relative survival models
	but, for the moment, it is feasible in routine only for the Hakulinen
	and Tenkanen model. Characteristics of the software should also be
	taken into account for routine relative survival analyses.},

Older patients do significantly worse than younger patients and are rarely included in clinical trials. Using data from Swedish Cancer and Lymphoma Registries, we estimated relative survival ratios (RSRs) for 7997 HL patients (diagnosed 1973-2013; 45% ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¥50ÃÂÃÂ years). The 1-year RSRs (95% confidence interval; CI) for males aged 45-59, 60-69, 70-80, and 81ÃÂÃÂ years and over, diagnosed in 2013, were 0.95 (0.91-0.97), 0.88 (0.81-0.92), 0.74 (0.63-0.81), and 0.52 (0.35-0.67), respectively. The corresponding 1-year RSRs for females were 0.97 (0.94-0.98), 0.91 (0.85-0.95), 0.82 (0.73-0.88), and 0.66 (0.50-0.77). No improvements in 1-year of 5-year relative survival from 2000 to 2013 were observed for patients aged 45-59 or 60-69 but there were modest improvements for patients aged 70ÃÂÃÂ years and older. Importantly, we saw no changes in the distribution of disease or patient characteristics between 2000 and 2013. Elderly patients constitute a large group with clearly unmet medical needs. Our findings motivate a more active approach to including elderly patients in clinical trials. Our study provides a baseline for outcome comparison after the broader introduction of targeted drugs.},

In a Swedish population-based cohort of 1947 HL patients diagnosed in 1992-2009 at ages 18-59 years, we estimated relative survival (RS), cure proportions (CP), and median survival times using flexible parametric cure models. Overall, the CP was 89% (95% CI: 0.87-0.91) and median survival of the uncured was 4.6 years (95% CI: 3.0-6.3). For patients aged 18-50 years diagnosed after the year 2000, CP was high and stable, whereas for patients of 50-59 years, cure was not reached. The survival of relapse-free patients was similar to that of the general population (RS5-year : 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99, RS15-year : 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97). The excess mortality of relapsing patients was 19 times (95% CI: 12-31) that of relapse-free patients. Despite modern treatments, patients with adverse prognostic factors (e.g., advanced stage) still had markedly worse outcomes [CP stage: IIIB 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.89); CP stage: IVB 0.72, (95% CI: 0.60-0.81)] and patients with international prognostic score (IPS) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¥3 had 2.7 times higher excess mortality (95% CI: 1.0-7.0, p = 0.04) than patients with IPS <3. High-risk patients selected for 6-8 courses of BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclofosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone)-chemotherapy had a 15-year relative survival of 87%, (95% CI: 0.80-0.92), whereas the corresponding estimate for patients selected for 6-8 courses of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) was 93% (95% CI: 0.88-0.97). These population-based results indicate limited fatal side-effects in the 15-year perspective with contemporary treatments, while the unmet need of effective relapse treatment remains of concern. BEACOPP-chemotherapy was still not sufficient in high-risk HL patients.},

In the absence of randomized trials, 2 possible approaches are the parametric g-formula and agent-based models (ABMs). The g-formula has been used exclusively to estimate effects in the population from which data were collected, whereas ABMs are commonly used to estimate effects in multiple populations, necessitating stronger assumptions. Here, we describe potential biases that arise when ABM assumptions do not hold. To do so, we estimated 12-month mortality risk in simulated populations differing in prevalence of an unknown common cause of mortality and a time-varying confounder. The ABM and g-formula correctly estimated mortality and causal effects when all inputs were from the target population. However, whenever any inputs came from another population, the ABM gave biased estimates of mortality-and often of causal effects even when the true effect was null. In the absence of unmeasured confounding and model misspecification, both methods produce valid causal inferences for a given population when all inputs are from that population. However, ABMs may result in bias when extrapolated to populations that differ on the distribution of unmeasured outcome determinants, even when the causal network linking variables is identical.},

Using a unique patient cohort, we have investigated whether time interval to second breast cancer (BC2) and mode of detection are associated to prognosis. Information on patient-, tumour-, treatment-characteristics, and outcome was abstracted from patients' individual charts for all patients diagnosed with metachronous CBC in the Southern Healthcare Region of Sweden from 1977-2007. Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and risk of distant metastases were primary endpoints. The cohort included 723 patients with metachronous contralateral breast cancer as primary breast cancer event. Patients with less than three years to BC2 had a significantly impaired DDFS (p = 0.01), and in sub-group analysis, this effect was seen primarily in patients aged <50. By logistic regression analysis, patients diagnosed with BC2 within routine follow-up examinations had a significantly lower risk of developing metastases compared to those who were symptomatic at diagnosis (p < 0.0001). Chemotherapy given after breast BC1 was a negative prognostic factor for DDFS, whereas endocrine treatment and radiotherapy given after BC2 improved DDFS. In a large cohort of patients with CBC, we found the time interval to BC2 to be a strong prognostic factor for DDFS in young women and mode of detection to be related to risk of distant metastases. Future studies of tumour biology of BC2 in relation to prognostic factors found in the present study can hopefully provide biological explanations to these findings.},

However, ambiguity remains regarding risk factors and prognosis for women with CBC. In a cohort of 42,670 women with breast cancer in the Uppsala/{\AA}rebro and Stockholm regions in Sweden in 1992 to 2008, we assessed risk factors for and prognosis of metachronous CBC by using survival analysis. Breast cancer-specific survival for women with CBC was evaluated and compared with results for women with unilateral breast cancer (UBC) by using time-dependent Cox-regression modeling. An increased risk for CBC was observed among women who had primary breast cancer with ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¥ 10 involved lymph nodes compared with node-negative women (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.7). The prognosis was poorer in women with CBC than with UBC. The hazard of dying from breast cancer was especially high for women with a short interval time to CBC (adjusted HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.8 for CBC diagnosed ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¤ 5 years v UBC) and gradually decreased with longer follow-up time but remained higher than the hazard originating from the primary tumor for ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¥ 10 years. Women with advanced-stage primary breast cancer had an increased risk of developing CBC. CBC is associated with an increased risk of dying from breast cancer throughout a long period of follow-up after the primary tumor. Our findings suggest that the event of CBC marks a new clinical situation in terms of investigations for metastases, treatment considerations, and follow-up strategy.},

  abstract        = {Estrogen receptor (ER) status is important for breast cancer survival, it is however unclear how prognosis of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) is affected by ER-status of the two tumors. We conducted a large, population-based study of ER-status of both tumors in CBC patients and its influence on prognosis. The cohort consisted of all women diagnosed with CBC in Stockholm, Sweden during 1976-2005, with information on ER-status from medical records (N = 933). Prognosis was modeled as incidence rates of distant metastasis via Poisson regression. The proportion of CBCs with both cancers of the same ER-status was significantly larger than expected by chance. For synchronous (simultaneous) cancers the prognosis was significantly affected by the combined ER-status of both tumors (p = 0.01). Compared to unilateral breast cancer patients the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for patients with double ER-positive tumors was 1.25 (95 % CI: 0.88-1.76), for ER-discordant tumors 2.19 (95 % CI: 1.18-4.08) and for double ER-negative tumors 3.95 (95 % CI: 1.77-8.81). For metachronous (non-simultaneous) cancers, women with double ER-positive tumors had similarly bad prognosis (IRR = 2.95; 95 % CI: 2.39-3.64) as women with double ER-negative tumors (IRR = 2.88; 95 % CI: 1.83-4.52). Both shorter time span between first and second cancer and endocrine therapy for the first cancer further worsened prognosis of women with double ER-positive metachronous CBC. For synchronous CBC patients, ER-pattern of both tumors is an important prognosticator, while among metachronous CBC patients, double ER-positive tumors confer equally bad prognosis as double ER-negative cancers. Our results indicate that this might be due to endocrine therapy resistance.},

  abstract        = {The burden of cancer is growing, and the disease is becoming a major economic expenditure for all developed countries. In 2008, the worldwide cost of cancer due to premature death and disability (not including direct medical costs) was estimated to be US$895 billion. This is not simply due to an increase in absolute numbers, but also the rate of increase of expenditure on cancer. What are the drivers and solutions to the so-called cancer-cost curve in developed countries? How are we going to afford to deliver high quality and equitable care? Here, expert opinion from health-care professionals, policy makers, and cancer survivors has been gathered to address the barriers and solutions to delivering affordable cancer care. Although many of the drivers and themes are specific to a particular field-eg, the huge development costs for cancer medicines-there is strong concordance running through each contribution. Several drivers of cost, such as over-use, rapid expansion, and shortening life cycles of cancer technologies (such as medicines and imaging modalities), and the lack of suitable clinical research and integrated health economic studies, have converged with more defensive medical practice, a less informed regulatory system, a lack of evidence-based sociopolitical debate, and a declining degree of fairness for all patients with cancer. Urgent solutions range from re-engineering of the macroeconomic basis of cancer costs (eg, value-based approaches to bend the cost curve and allow cost-saving technologies), greater education of policy makers, and an informed and transparent regulatory system. A radical shift in cancer policy is also required. Political toleration of unfairness in access to affordable cancer treatment is unacceptable. The cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence base and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost; rather, we need delivery of fair prices and real value from new technologies.},

Survival data from population registries, estimated resource use from clinical practice and quality of life estimates were employed. Substantial health gains were noted over time, paralleled by increased treatment costs. Median survival was 1.9, 4.0 and 13 years during the respective time periods. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between periods III and II was ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬52,700 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. An estimated 80% price reduction of imatinib, related to patent expiry, would reduce this ICER to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¬22,700.

To accomplish this task, we define exposures as treatments and posit populations exposed or unexposed to these well-defined regimens. This inferential structure allows us to unambiguously estimate and interpret quantitative causal parameters and to investigate how these may be affected by biases such as confounding. This paradigm has been challenged recently by some critics who favor broadening the exposures that may be studied beyond treatments to also consider states. Defining the exposure protocol of an observational study is a continuum of specificity, and one may choose to loosen this definition, incurring the cost of causal parameters that become commensurately more vague. The advantages and disadvantages of broader versus narrower definitions of exposure are matters of continuing debate in social epidemiology as in other branches of epidemiology.},

Alternative measures provide additional insights and may help in communicating the results to a wider audience. We describe these alternative measures in two data settings, the overall survival setting and the relative survival setting, the latter corresponding to the particular competing risk setting in which the cause of death is unavailable or unreliable. In the overall survival setting, we describe the overall survival probability, the conditional survival probability and the restricted mean survival time (restricted to a prespecified time window). In the relative survival setting, we describe the net survival probability, the conditional net survival probability, the restricted mean net survival time, the crude probability of death due to each cause and the number of life years lost due to each cause over a prespecified time window. These measures describe survival data either on a probability scale or on a timescale. The clinical or population health purpose of each measure is detailed, and their advantages and drawbacks are discussed. We then illustrate their use analyzing England population-based registry data of men 15-80 years old diagnosed with colon cancer in 2001-2003, aiming to describe the deprivation disparities in survival. We believe that both the provision of a detailed example of the interpretation of each measure and the software implementation will help in generalizing their use.},

  abstract     = {Describing the relationship between socioeconomic inequalities and cancer survival is important but methodologically challenging. We propose guidelines for addressing these challenges and illustrate their implementation on French population-based data. We analyzed 17 cancers. Socioeconomic deprivation was measured by an ecological measure, the European Deprivation Index (EDI). The Excess Mortality Hazard (EMH), ie, the mortality hazard among cancer patients after accounting for other causes of death, was modeled using a flexible parametric model, allowing for nonlinear and/or time-dependent association between the EDI and the EMH. The model included a cluster-specific random effect to deal with the hierarchical structure of the data. We reported the conventional age-standardized net survival (ASNS) and described the changes of the EMH over the time since diagnosis at different levels of deprivation. We illustrated nonlinear and/or time-dependent associations between the EDI and the EMH by plotting the excess hazard ratio according to EDI values at different times after diagnosis. The median excess hazard ratio quantified the general contextual effect. Lip-oral cavity-pharynx cancer in men showed the widest deprivation gap, with 5-year ASNS at 41% and 29% for deprivation quintiles 1 and 5, respectively, and we found a nonlinear association between the EDI and the EMH. The EDI accounted for a substantial part of the general contextual effect on the EMH. The association between the EDI and the EMH was time dependent in stomach and pancreas cancers in men and in cervix cancer. The methodological guidelines proved efficient in describing the way socioeconomic inequalities influence cancer survival. Their use would allow comparisons between different health care systems.},

When the study sample is not a random sample of the target population, the sample average treatment effect, even if internally valid, cannot usually be expected to equal the average treatment effect in the target population. The utility of an effect estimate for planning purposes and decision making will depend on the degree of departure from the true causal effect in the target population due to problems with both internal and external validity. Herein, we review concepts from recent literature on generalizability, one facet of external validity, using the potential outcomes framework. Identification conditions sufficient for external validity closely parallel identification conditions for internal validity, namely conditional exchangeability; positivity; the same distributions of the versions of treatment; no interference; and no measurement error. We also require correct model specification. Under these conditions, we discuss how a version of direct standardization (the g-formula, adjustment formula, or transport formula) or inverse probability weighting can be used to generalize a causal effect from a study sample to a well-defined target population, and demonstrate their application in an illustrative example.},

The doubly robust estimator combines these 2 approaches such that only 1 of the 2 models need be correctly specified to obtain an unbiased effect estimator. In this introduction to doubly robust estimators, the authors present a conceptual overview of doubly robust estimation, a simple worked example, results from a simulation study examining performance of estimated and bootstrapped standard errors, and a discussion of the potential advantages and limitations of this method.

The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89% (95% confidence interval: 1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses' Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale application of the parametric g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.},

A cause-specific cumulative probability can be obtained with a combination of the CSHs or via the subdistribution hazard. Here, we modeled the CSH with flexible hazard-based regression models using B-splines for the baseline hazard and time-dependent (TD) effects. We derived the variance of the cause-specific cumulative probabilities at the population level using the multivariate delta method and showed how we could easily quantify the impact of a covariate on the cumulative probability scale using covariate-adjusted cause-specific cumulative probabilities and their difference. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of this approach in its ability to estimate the cumulative probabilities using different functions for the cause-specific log baseline hazard and with or without a TD effect. In the scenario with TD effect, we tested both well-specified and misspecified models. We showed that the flexible regression models perform nearly as well as the nonparametric method, if we allow enough flexibility for the baseline hazards. Moreover, neglecting the TD effect hardly affects the cumulative probabilities estimates of the whole population but impacts them in the various subgroups. We illustrated our approach using data from people diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and provided the R-code to derive those quantities, as an extension of the R-package mexhaz.},

  abstract        = {In survival analysis, a competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. Outcomes in medical research are frequently subject to competing risks. In survival analysis, there are 2 key questions that can be addressed using competing risk regression models: first, which covariates affect the rate at which events occur, and second, which covariates affect the probability of an event occurring over time. The cause-specific hazard model estimates the effect of covariates on the rate at which events occur in subjects who are currently event-free. Subdistribution hazard ratios obtained from the Fine-Gray model describe the relative effect of covariates on the subdistribution hazard function. Hence, the covariates in this model can also be interpreted as having an effect on the cumulative incidence function or on the probability of events occurring over time. We conducted a review of the use and interpretation of the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model in articles published in the medical literature in 2015. We found that many authors provided an unclear or incorrect interpretation of the regression coefficients associated with this model. An incorrect and inconsistent interpretation of regression coefficients may lead to confusion when comparing results across different studies. Furthermore, an incorrect interpretation of estimated regression coefficients can result in an incorrect understanding about the magnitude of the association between exposure and the incidence of the outcome. The objective of this article is to clarify how these regression coefficients should be reported and to propose suggestions for interpreting these coefficients.},

Early diagnosis can be defined by the disease stage at diagnosis or by other indicators derived from electronic health records. We evaluate the association between different early diagnosis indicators and survival, and discuss the implementation of the indicators in surveillance of early diagnosis. We searched the PubMed database and grey literature to identify early diagnosis indicators and evaluate their association with survival. We analysed cancer registrations for 355,502 cancer patients diagnosed in England during the period 2009-2013, and quantified the association between each early diagnosis indicator and 30-day mortality and five-year net survival. Each incremental difference in stage (I-IV) predicts lower 5-year survival, so prognostic information is lost in comparisons which use binary stage indicators. Patients without a recorded stage have high risk of death shortly following diagnosis and lower 5-year survival. Emergency presentation is independently associated with lower five-year survival. Shorter intervals between first symptoms and diagnosis are not consistently associated with improved survival, potentially due to confounding from tumour characteristics. Contrary to current practice, we recommend that all the stage information should be used in surveillance. Patients missing stage should also be included to minimise bias. Combined data on stage and emergency presentation could be used to create summary prognostic measures. More work is needed to create statistics based on the diagnostic interval that will be useful for surveillance.},

We searched the Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases up to May 31, 2016. Forty-five studies published between 1984 and 2016 were included. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted relative risk estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Most studies reported worse survival for cancer patients living in rural areas than those in urban regions. The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival. Further research is needed to disentangle the mediating effects of these factors, which may help to establish effective interventions to improve survival for patients living outside major cities.},

We analysed data from the National Cancer Registration Service's (NCRS) Cancer Analysis System on persons diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, prostate or ovarian cancers in England in 2012. One-year relative survival (followed-up to the end of 2013) was calculated along with adjusted excess rate ratios, for mortality within 1 year. One-year relative survival decreased with increasing stage at diagnosis. For breast, prostate and colorectal cancers survival showed a major reduction for stage 4 cancers, whereas for lung and ovarian cancers there were substantial decreases in relative survival for each level of increase in stage. Excess rate ratios for mortality within 1 year of diagnosis showed that stage and age were the most important cofactors, but they also identified the statistically significant effects of sex, income deprivation and geographic area of residence. Further reductions in mortality may be most effectively achieved by diagnosing all cancers before they progress to stage 4, but for lung and ovarian cancers there is also a need for a stage shift to earlier stages together with efforts to improve stage-specific survival at all stages.},

  abstract        = {This paper describes a means of analysing the effects that the benefit of early treatment, lead time and length-biased sampling (and other forms of prognostic selection bias) have on the mortality rate of cases detected in screening programmes. Both benefit and lead time reduce the mortality rate of screen-detected cases. A beneficial effect of early treatment will lead to a decrease in the number of deaths, the numerator of the rate. The amount of person-time among screen-detected cases, the denominator, is increased by early diagnosis as a result of screening (lead-time) as well as by prolongation of life due to early treatment. The numbers of cases experiencing benefit and lead time can be estimated by comparisons of the numbers of deaths and numbers of diagnosed cases between the entire screened population, from which the series of screen-detected cases is drawn, and an otherwise comparable unscreened population. Benefit and lead time, as reflected in these numbers, can be removed from the mortality rate of cases detected by screening. The effects of benefit or lead time on prognosis then can be assessed by comparing the observed mortality rate of screen-detected cases to the rates with benefit or lead time removed. Prognostic selection bias (a tendency of screen-detected cases to be relatively benign or relatively malignant) can be evaluated by comparing the case-mortality rate, with both benefit and lead time removed, to the mortality rate of cases in an unscreened population. The relationships described are illustrated with data from a breast cancer screening programme.},

  abstract        = {Mediation analyses have been a popular approach to investigate the effect of an exposure on an outcome through a mediator. Mediation models with multiple mediators have been proposed for continuous and dichotomous outcomes. However, development of multimediator models for survival outcomes is still limited. We present methods for multimediator analyses using three survival models: Aalen additive hazard models, Cox proportional hazard models, and semiparametric probit models. Effects through mediators can be characterized by path-specific effects, for which definitions and identifiability assumptions are provided. We derive closed-form expressions for path-specific effects for the three models, which are intuitively interpreted using a causal diagram. Mediation analyses using Cox models under the rare-outcome assumption and Aalen additive hazard models consider effects on log hazard ratio and hazard difference, respectively; analyses using semiparametric probit models consider effects on difference in transformed survival time and survival probability. The three models were applied to a hepatitis study where we investigated effects of hepatitis C on liver cancer incidence mediated through baseline and/or follow-up hepatitis B viral load. The three methods show consistent results on respective effect scales, which suggest an adverse estimated effect of hepatitis C on liver cancer not mediated through hepatitis B, and a protective estimated effect mediated through the baseline (and possibly follow-up) of hepatitis B viral load. Causal mediation analyses of survival outcome with multiple mediators are developed for additive hazard and proportional hazard and probit models with utility demonstrated in a hepatitis study.},

This study defines a methodology by which the route the patient follows to the point of diagnosis can be categorised to examine demographic, organisational, service and personal reasons for delayed diagnosis. Administrative Hospital Episode Statistics data are linked with Cancer Waiting Times data, data from the cancer screening programmes and cancer registration data. Using these data sets, every case of cancer registered in England, which was diagnosed in 2006-2008, is categorised into one of eight 'Routes to Diagnosis'. Different cancer types show substantial differences between the proportion of cases that present by each route, in reasonable agreement with previous clinical studies. Patients presenting via Emergency routes have substantially lower 1-year relative survival. Linked cancer registration and administrative data can be used to robustly categorise the route to a cancer diagnosis for all patients. These categories can be used to enhance understanding of and explore possible reasons for delayed diagnosis.},

This article introduces a new measure called the "E-value," which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjustments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confidence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evidence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.},

  abstract        = {Unmeasured confounding may undermine the validity of causal inference with observational studies. Sensitivity analysis provides an attractive way to partially circumvent this issue by assessing the potential influence of unmeasured confounding on causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity analysis approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as having an unmeasured confounder that is binary, or having no interaction between the effects of the exposure and the confounder on the outcome, or having only one unmeasured confounder. Without imposing any assumptions on the unmeasured confounder or confounders, we derive a bounding factor and a sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis parameters must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to explain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level. Our approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity parameters. Surprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is no more conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis techniques that do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor implies not only the traditional Cornfield conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on the confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy but also a high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy. Furthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure of the strength of confounding between the exposure and the outcome induced by a confounder.},

To substantially expand the limited data on diagnostic accuracy and completeness for lymphoproliferative (LP) tumors in such databases, we conducted a retrospective investigation of close to 1,000 cases diagnosed during 4 decades in Sweden. We identified and reviewed medical records for 494 LP tumor patients reported to the population-based Swedish Cancer registry and 503 LP tumor patients identified from hospitals in Sweden among patients with LP tumors diagnosed during 1964-2003. The stratified samples were randomly selected from patients according to LP subtype, over 4 equal calendar periods, and among 6 selected hospitals of diverse size and from different geographic regions. We found 97.9% of reported LP tumor cases to fulfill current diagnostic criteria for having an LP tumor and observed 89.7% to have accurate LP tumor subtype. The overall completeness of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma cases in the Cancer registry was 95-99% but was lower for the more indolent tumors, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (87.9%) and Waldenstr{\"o}m's macroglobulinemia (68.1%). We observed increased overall under-ascertainment for patients diagnosed above age 80 (27%) and among individuals diagnosed before 1973 (12%). In conclusion the diagnostic accuracy and completeness for classically defined LP tumor entities in the Swedish Cancer registry is high. However, we found under-ascertainment of patients with indolent LP tumors, particularly among patients diagnosed at older ages, with early-stage disease and diagnosed in earlier years.},

  abstract        = {It has consistently been shown that women who are diagnosed with bladder cancer have lower survival than men, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Most studies assumed that the sex-specific mortality ratio is constant over time, possibly resulting in inaccurate estimates in various periods of follow-up. This study aimed to investigate the sex-specific excess mortality in bladder cancer patients and its variation over follow-up time. Observational cohort study. Using data from the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry, we studied 24,169 patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2014 with histologically confirmed ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¥T1 bladder cancer with follow-up until January 2018. We used flexible parametric relative survival models to estimate excess mortality as a function of time for each sex and to explore the effect of covariates on these functions. Female patients (24%) had worse clinical tumor, node, and metastasis-stage at diagnosis and more often a nonurothelial tumor histology. The excess mortality ratio of sex was not constant over time; in the first two years after diagnosis excess mortality rates for women were higher than for men, but lower thereafter; this applied to both nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer subgroups. Baseline differences in age, tumor, node, and metastasis-stage and histology accounted for only part of the excess mortality gap. The assumption of proportional hazards over time leads to underestimation of the excess mortality ratio for women in the first two years and overestimation thereafter, when excess mortality is comparable for women and men. Clinicians should incorporate the initial sex-specific poorer outcome in their considerations regarding prognosis and treatment options for female patients, e.g., more invasive treatment and neo-adjuvant treatment. These findings also point towards a mechanism of micrometastatic disease, warranting assessment of sex-specific efficacy in randomized controlled trials on treatments in this patient population.},

  abstract        = {Cancer survival statistics are typically reported by using measures discounting the impact of other-cause mortality, such as net survival. This is a hypothetical measure and is interpreted as excluding the possibility of cancer patients dying from other causes. Crude probability of death partitions the all-cause probability of death into deaths from cancer and other causes. The National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service is the single cancer registry for England. In 2006-2015, 1,590,477 malignant tumours were diagnosed for breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma and prostate cancer in adults. We used a relative survival framework, with a period approach, providing estimates for up to 10-year survival. Mortality was partitioned into deaths due to cancer or other causes. Unconditional and conditional (on surviving 1-years and 5-years) crude probability of death were estimated for the five cancers. Elderly patients who survived for a longer period before dying were more likely to die from other causes of death (except for lung cancer). For younger patients, deaths were almost entirely due to the cancer. There are different measures of survival, each with their own strengths and limitations. Careful choices of survival measures are needed for specific scenarios to maximise the understanding of the data.},

Specifically, the focus is on methods that combine shorter-term individual-level survival data from randomized trials with longer-term external data, thus using the longer-term data to aid extrapolation of the short-term data. This requires assumptions about how trends in survival for each treatment arm will continue after the follow-up period of the trial. Furthermore, using external data requires assumptions about how survival differs between the populations represented by the trial and external data. Study reports from a national health technology assessment program in the United Kingdom were searched, and the findings were combined with ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂpearl-growingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ searches of the academic literature. We categorized the methods that have been used according to the assumptions they made about how the hazards of death vary between the external and internal data and through time, and we discuss the appropriateness of the assumptions in different circumstances. Modeling choices, parameter estimation, and characterization of uncertainty are discussed, and some suggestions for future research priorities in this area are given.},

Survival data of the patients of interest are usually highly censored, and observed expenditures are incomplete. In this study, we propose a survival-adjusted estimator for estimating mean lifetime costs, which integrates the product of the survival function and the mean cost function over the lifetime horizon. The survival function is estimated by a new algorithm of rolling extrapolation, aided by external information of age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national vital statistics. The mean cost function is estimated by a weighted average of mean expenditures of patients in a number of months prior to their death, of which the number could be determined by observed costs in their final months, and the weights depend on extrapolated hazards. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with that of a popular method using simulated data under various scenarios and 2 cohorts of intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke patients with a maximum follow-up of 13Â years and conclude that our new method estimates the mean lifetime costs more accurately.},

  abstract  = {Objective. Survival extrapolation using a single, best-fit model ignores 2 sources of model uncertainty: uncertainty in the true underlying distribution and uncertainty about the stability of the model parameters over time. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has been used to account for the former, but it can also account for the latter. We investigated BMA using a published comparison of the Charnley and Spectron hip prostheses using the original 8-year follow-up registry data. Methods. A wide variety of alternative distributions were fitted. Two additional distributions were used to address uncertainty about parameter stability: optimistic and skeptical. The optimistic (skeptical) model represented the model distribution with the highest (lowest) estimated probabilities of survival but reestimated using, as prior information, the most optimistic (skeptical) parameter estimated for intermediate follow-up periods. Distributions were then averaged assuming the same posterior probabilities for the optimistic, skeptical, and noninformative models. Cost-effectiveness was compared using both the original 8-year and extended 16-year follow-up data. Results. We found that all models obtained similar revision-free years during the observed period. In contrast, there was variability over the decision time horizon. Over the observed period, we detected considerable uncertainty in the shape parameter for Spectron. After BMA, Spectron was cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 with 93\% probability, whereas the best-fit model was 100\%; by contrast, with a 16-year follow-up, it was 0\%. Conclusions. This case study casts doubt on the ability of the single best-fit model selected by information criteria statistics to adequately capture model uncertainty. Under this scenario, BMA weighted by posterior probabilities better addressed model uncertainty. However, there is still value in regularly updating health economic models, even where decision uncertainty is low.},

An important advantage of the rank-dependent QALY model is that it offers a straightforward procedure to estimate equity weights for QALYs.

  abstract        = {Besides lifetime risks, we estimated life expectancy (LE), expected years of life lost (EYLL), lifetime costs, and cost-per-LY (life-year) stratified by different stages of esophageal cancer (EC). From the Taiwan Cancer Registry, we collected 14,420 EC to estimate the incidence rates during 2008-2014. They were followed to 2015 to obtain the survival function, which was extrapolated to lifetime by a semiparametric method. We abstracted the monthly healthcare expenditures from the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance, which were multiplied with the corresponding survival probabilities to quantify lifetime cost and cost-per-LY after adjustments. About 93.7% of patients were male; 90.8% had squamous cell carcinoma. Most patients were diagnosed at advanced stages, with 44.6% and 28.3% at stages III and IV. The lifetime risk of EC in males increased in Taiwan with a cumulative incidence rate (CIR ) of 0.0146% (2008~2010) to 0.0165% (2013-2014). The EYLL for stages I-IV were 15.8, 17.5, 20.5, and 22.5, while the average of cost-per-LY for stages I-IV were US$ 6,987, $8,776, $12,153, and $22,426. EC in Taiwan appears to have shifted into younger ages groups and incidence is still increasing. Strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment are warranted to improve the cost-effectiveness and control of this cancer.},

  abstract     = {The mortality rates for different cancers are no longer an efficient tool for making national policy. The purpose of this study were to quantify the lifetime risks, life expectancies (LEs) after diagnosis, expected years of life lost (EYLL), and lifetime health care expenditures for 19 major cancers in Taiwan. A total of 831,314 patients with 19 pathologically proven cancers were abstracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2012. They were linked to the National Mortality Registry (1998-2014) and National Health Insurance reimbursement database (1998-2013) for survival and health care costs. We estimated the cumulative incidence rate for ages 0-79 years and the lifetime survival function for patients with different cancer sites. The EYLL was calculated by subtracting the LE of each cancer cohort from that of the age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national life tables. The estimated lifetime cost was calculated by adding up the product of survival probability and mean cost at the corresponding duration-to-date after adjustment for the inflation to the year of 2013. There were 5 cancers with a lifetime risk exceeding 4%: colorectal, liver, lung, and prostate in males, and breast and colorectal in females. Cancers with EYLL of >10 years were: esophageal, intrahepatic bile ducts, liver, pancreas, oral, nasopharyngeal, leukemia, lung, and gallbladder, extrahepatic bile ducts and biliary tract in males, and intrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, nasopharyngeal, lung, esophageal, leukemia, liver, gallbladder, extrahepatic bile ducts and biliary tract, ovary, and stomach in females. Cancers with lifetime health care expenditures exceeding US$50,000 to the National Health Insurance were as follows: leukemia, kidney, testis, renal pelvis and ureter in males, and renal pelvis and ureter, leukemia, breast, urinary bladder, kidney, ovary, and nasopharyngeal in females. All these impacts should be considered in health policy decisions. The impacts of cancer in Taiwan are very large. Future studies must consider both quality of life and the entire impact from societal perspectives.},

  abstract        = {Epilepsy carries a risk of premature mortality, but little is known about life expectancy in people with the condition. The UK National General Practice Study of Epilepsy is a prospective, population-based study of people with newly diagnosed epilepsy. A cohort of 564 patients with definite epilepsy has been followed for nearly 15 years and there have been 177 deaths. These data have been used to estimate life expectancy of people in this cohort by employing a parametric survival model based on the Weibull distribution. Life expectancy in people with epilepsy was estimated as a function of age at, and time from, diagnosis according to two broad aetiological groups. These estimates were then compared with life expectancy in people of the same age and sex in the general population. Reduction in life expectancy can be up to 2 years for people with a diagnosis of idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy, and the reduction can be up to 10 years in people with symptomatic epilepsy. Reductions in life expectancy are highest at the time of diagnosis and diminish with time. Our model provides broad estimates, but it appears that the higher mortality rates in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy translate into decreased life expectancy.},

Parametric models of survival experience can be used to determine differences in life expectancy. Using the log-normal model, it is shown that the increases in 10-year survival rate found by the overviews of adjuvant systemic therapy trials in early breast cancer are consistent with only small overall increases in life expectancy of about 1 year for Stage I and about 2 years for Stage II. However, if adjuvant therapy transfers a patient from being not cured to being cured, then her life expectancy will have been improved by 16 years for Stage I disease and by 21 years for Stage II. Model analyses on large data sets, such as are available in overviews, could possibly provide some evidence on whether the effect of adjuvant systemic therapy is to increase the cure rate, with the consequent considerable increase in life expectancy for some patients, or whether the effect is only a small increase in life expectancy for those who are not cured.},

  abstract        = {In population-based cancer survival studies, the event of interest is usually death due to cancer. However, other competing events may be present. Relative survival is a commonly used measure in cancer studies that circumvents problems caused by the inaccuracy of the cause of death information. A summary of the prognosis of the cancer population and potential differences between subgroups can be obtained using marginal estimates of relative survival. We utilize regression standardization to obtain marginal estimates of interest in a relative survival framework. Such measures include the standardized relative survival, standardized all-cause survival and standardized crude probabilities of death. Contrasts of these can be formed to explore differences between exposure groups and under certain assumptions are interpreted as causal effects. The difference in standardized all-cause survival can also provide an estimate for the impact of eliminating cancer-related differences between exposure groups. The potential avoidable deaths after such hypothetical scenarios can also be estimated. To illustrate the methods we use the example of survival differences across socio-economic groups for colon cancer. Using relative survival, a range of marginal measures and contrasts were estimated. For these measures we either focused on cancer-related differences only or chose to incorporate both cancer and other cause differences. The impact of eliminating differences between groups was also estimated. Another useful way for quantifying that impact is the avoidable deaths under hypothetical scenarios. Marginal estimates within the relative survival framework provide useful summary measures and can be applied to better understand differences across exposure groups.},

  abstract        = {Previous studies on the effect of marital bereavement on mortality have suggested various time periods during which the risk of mortality is increased. As many of the studies compared the widowed group with national mortality statistics for the married, there has been no opportunity to adjust for confounders which might themselves be responsible for this increased risk after bereavement. In this paper the various hypotheses proposed are reviewed and then modelled on a dataset of 344 elderly persons who were living with a spouse and who were part of a survey of a population of people aged 75 years and over. The 344 index-cases and their spouses were followed up for seven years and the times of death (for those who died) of the index-case and spouse were noted. The data were analysed by fitting a proportional hazards model to the subject's survival time after adjustment for other factors such as mental and physical health which had already been shown to be associated with mortality. The bereavement effects were fitted as time-dependent covariates. The best fitting model for females and males indicated an increased relative risk of mortality which lasted for approximately six months after bereavement. In the case of widows this relative risk was significantly increased, being 3.8 with 95 per cent confidence interval (1.4, 10.3) while for widowers the risk was 0.03 with 95 per cent confidence interval (0.00, 37.3).},

Generally, trial data must be extrapolated, and many models are available for this purpose. The choice of extrapolation model is critical because different models can lead to very different cost-effectiveness results. A failure to systematically justify the chosen model creates the possibility of bias and inconsistency between HTAs. To demonstrate the limitations and inconsistencies associated with the survival analysis component of HTAs and to propose a process guide that will help exclude these from future analyses. We reviewed the survival analysis component of 45 HTAs undertaken for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the cancer disease area. We drew upon our findings to identify common limitations and to develop a process guide. The chosen survival models were not systematically justified in any of the HTAs reviewed. The range of models considered was usually insufficient, and the rationale for the chosen model was universally limited: In particular, the plausibility of the extrapolated portion of fitted survival curves was very rarely explicitly considered. Limitations. We do not seek to describe and review all methods available for performing survival analysis-several approaches exist that are not mentioned in this article. Instead we seek to analyze methods commonly used in HTAs and limitations associated with their application. Survival analysis has not been conducted systematically in HTAs. A systematic approach such as the one proposed here is required to reduce the possibility of bias in cost-effectiveness results and inconsistency between technology assessments.},

We identified patients (n=886,380) diagnosed with invasive CRC between 2001 and 2011 from a nationally representative cancer dataset. We stratified these patients by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Using these data and data from the 2001-2011 U.S. life tables, we estimated a survival function for each CRC group and the corresponding reference group and computed per-person LYs saved. We estimated per-person annual healthcare cost-savings using the 2008-2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We calculated aggregate LYs saved and cost-savings by multiplying the reduced number of CRC patients by the per-person LYs saved and lifetime healthcare cost-savings, respectively. We estimated an aggregate of 84,569 and 64,924 LYs saved for men and women, respectively, accounting for healthcare cost-savings of $329.3 and $294.2 million (in 2013$), respectively. Per person, we estimated 6.3 potential LYs saved related to those who developed CRC for both men and women, and healthcare cost-savings of $24,000 for men and $28,000 for women. Non-Hispanic whites and those aged 60-64 had the highest aggregate potential LYs saved and cost-savings. Achieving the HP2020 objective of reducing invasive CRC incidence by 15% by year 2020 would potentially save nearly 150,000 life-years and $624 million on healthcare costs.},

  abstract     = {Survival has improved among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with the addition of anti-CD20 antibody therapy. We aimed to quantify trends and remaining loss in expectation of life (LEL) due to DLBCL at a national population-based level. Patients diagnosed with DLBCL 2000-2013 (N = 7114) were identified through the Swedish Lymphoma Registry and classified according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI). The novel measure LEL is the difference between remaining life years among patients and the general population and was predicted using flexible parametric models from diagnosis and among 2-year survivors, by age and sex. Median age at DLBCL-diagnosis was 70 (18-105) years and 54.8% presented with stage III-IV disease. On average, LEL due to DLBCL decreased from 8.0 (95% CI: 7.7-8.3) to 4.6 (95% CI: 4.5-4.6) years over the study period. By risk group, LEL was most reduced among patients with aaIPI ≥2 aged 50-60 years. However, these patients were still estimated to lose >8 years in 2013 (eg, LEL  8.6 years (95% CI: 5.0-12.3)). Among 2-year survivors, LEL was reduced from 6.1 years (95% CI: 5.6-6.5) (aaIPI ≥ 2) and 3.8 years (95% CI: 3.6-4.1) (aaIPI < 2) to 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1-1.2) and 1.0 year (95% CI: 0.8-1.1), respectively. The reduction was observed across all ages. Results for females were similar. By using LEL we illustrate the improvement of DLBCL survival over time. Despite adequate immunochemotherapy, substantial LEL among patients with IPI ≥ 2 points to remaining unmet medical needs. We speculate that observed reduced losses among 2-year survivors indicate a reduction of late relapses.},

  abstract        = {Prognostic models are typically developed in studies covering long time periods. However, if more recent years have seen improvements in survival, then using the full dataset may lead to out-of-date survival predictions. Period analysis addresses this by developing the model in a subset of the data from a recent time window, but results in a reduction of sample size. We propose a new approach, called temporal recalibration, to combine the advantages of period analysis and full cohort analysis. This approach develops a model in the entire dataset and then recalibrates the baseline survival using a period analysis sample.The approaches are demonstrated utilizing a prognostic model in colon cancer built using both Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric survival models with data from 1996-2005 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database. Comparison of model predictions with observed survival estimates were made for new patients subsequently diagnosed in 2006 and followed-up until 2015. Period analysis and temporal recalibration provided more up-to-date survival predictions that more closely matched observed survival in subsequent data than the standard full cohort models. In addition, temporal recalibration provided more precise estimates of predictor effects. Prognostic models are typically developed using a full cohort analysis that can result in out-of-date long-term survival estimates when survival has improved in recent years. Temporal recalibration is a simple method to address this, which can be used when developing and updating prognostic models to ensure survival predictions are more closely calibrated with the observed survival of individuals diagnosed subsequently.},

Recent efforts have focused on improving the accuracy of these prediction models by adding novel biomarkers to a common set of baseline risk predictors. Few have considered incorporating repeated measures of the common risk predictors. Through application to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and simulations, we compare models that use simple summary measures of the repeat information on systolic blood pressure, such as (i) baseline only; (ii) last observation carried forward; and (iii) cumulative mean, against more complex methods that model the repeat information using (iv) ordinary regression calibration; (v) risk-set regression calibration; and (vi) joint longitudinal and survival models. In comparison with the baseline-only model, we observed modest improvements in discrimination and calibration using the cumulative mean of systolic blood pressure, but little further improvement from any of the complex methods. © 2016 The Authors.

To review the state of the field and provide recommendations to improve the quality of cost-effectiveness analyses. The intended audiences include researchers, government policy makers, public health officials, health care administrators, payers, businesses, clinicians, patients, and consumers. In 2012, the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine was formed and included 2 co-chairs, 13 members, and 3 additional members of a leadership group. These members were selected on the basis of their experience in the field to provide broad expertise in the design, conduct, and use of cost-effectiveness analyses. Over the next 3.5 years, the panel developed recommendations by consensus. These recommendations were then reviewed by invited external reviewers and through a public posting process. The concept of a "reference case" and a set of standard methodological practices that all cost-effectiveness analyses should follow to improve quality and comparability are recommended. All cost-effectiveness analyses should report 2 reference case analyses: one based on a health care sector perspective and another based on a societal perspective. The use of an "impact inventory," which is a structured table that contains consequences (both inside and outside the formal health care sector), intended to clarify the scope and boundaries of the 2 reference case analyses is also recommended. This special communication reviews these recommendations and others concerning the estimation of the consequences of interventions, the valuation of health outcomes, and the reporting of cost-effectiveness analyses. The Second Panel reviewed the current status of the field of cost-effectiveness analysis and developed a new set of recommendations. Major changes include the recommendation to perform analyses from 2 reference case perspectives and to provide an impact inventory to clarify included consequences.},

  abstract        = {Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia (WA) over recent decades. Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) is a useful measure for assessing cancer survival at a population-level. Some previous studies estimating LOLE have required a minimum follow-up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled extrapolation, while others have not. The first aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimum length of follow-up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed in 2006 with female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, cervical, combined oesophageal and stomach cancers, and melanoma. Based on these results, the second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for diagnoses between 1982 and 2016. Person-level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 15-89 years. The analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006, followed to the end of 2006 (i.e. no minimum follow-up), 2011 (i.e. five years minimum follow-up, assuming survival) or 2016 (i.e. 10 years minimum follow-up). To achieve the second study aim, the diagnostic period was extended to the end of 2016. Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible parametric relative survival models. Single-year age and sex-specific death rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life expectancy. Temporal changes were not reported for prostate, cervical, oesophageal and stomach cancers or melanoma, due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum follow-up time, or estimate imprecision. Marked reductions in LOLE were observed for female breast and colorectal cancer. There was minimal absolute reduction for lung cancer, where LOLE remained high. This study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE, finding variation in estimates with differing minimum follow-up or high parameter uncertainty for most included cancer types. Temporal changes in LOLE in-turn reflected changes in the life expectancy of the general population, cancer detection and management. These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting LOLE estimates.},

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that using a standardization pre-weighting approach is a viable alternative approach for external age-standardization in population-based cancer data and performs well in cases of sparsity. We further de;1;scribe how the pre-weighting approach to age-standardization can be coupled with the Pohar Perme estimator in both a cohort and period analysis setting. For period analysis, we compare approaches for defining the internal age distribution. We use SEER public use data to illustrate our approach and estimate survival for Connecticut and by race to create a scenario with sufficient sparsity. The pre-weighting approach gives comparable estimates to traditional age-standardization in cases with sufficient data and produces estimates throughout follow-up in cases of sparsity when a traditional approach would fail. International comparison studies and other national population-based survival studies that need to age-standardize estimates for comparability purposes should adopt the Pohar Perme estimator with pre-weighting. This approach avoids issues of non-estimation in the case of sparsity and will allow more consistent comparisons across the produced estimates.},

The hypothetical nature of this definition has led to confusion and incorrect interpretation. For any measure to be fair in terms of comparing cancer survival, then differences between population groups should depend only on differences in excess mortality rates due to the cancer and not differences in other-cause mortality rates or differences in the age distribution. We propose using crude probabilities of death and all-cause survival which incorporate reference expected mortality rates. This makes it possible to obtain marginal crude probabilities and all-cause probability of death that only differ between population groups due to excess mortality rate differences. Choices have to be made regarding what reference mortality rates to use and what age distribution to standardize to. We illustrate the method and some potential choices using data from England for men diagnosed with melanoma. Various marginal measures are presented and compared. The new measures help enhance understanding of cancer survival and are a complement to the more commonly used measures.},

In particular, there are variations in recorded date of incidence (DOI) as cancer registries have access to different sources of information and use different rules to determine an official DOI. This study investigates the impact of different DOI rules on cancer survival estimates. Detailed data on dates of pathological confirmation and hospital admittance were collected from three registries participating in the ICBP SURVMARK-2 project (England, Northern Ireland and Norway). Multiple dates of incidence were determined for each cancer patient diagnosed during 2010-2014 by applying three sets of rules that prioritize either: a) histological date, b) hospital admittance date or c) the earliest date recorded. For each set of rules and registry, 1- and 5-year net survival were estimated for eight cancer sites (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, lung and ovary). The mean difference between different DOIs within a country and cancer site ranged from 0.1-23 days. The variation in 1- and 5-year net survival using different DOIs were generally small for all registries and cancer sites. Only for liver and pancreatic cancer in Norway and ovarian cancer in England, were larger 1-year survival differences, of 2-3 % found. In the ongoing discussion of the comparability of survival estimates across registry populations, the use of different DOI definitions can be considered to have a very limited impact.},

Cancer registry data consisted of English patients diagnosed with NSCLC from 2012 to 2016. Linked hospital records identified CVD comorbidities. We investigated resection rate variation by geographical region using funnel plots; resection and death rates using time-to-event analysis. We modelled an increased propensity for resection in regions with the lowest resection rates and estimated survival change. Among 57,373 patients with Stage 1-3A NSCLC, resection rates varied considerably between regions. Patients with CVD comorbidity had lower resection rates and higher mortality rates. CVD comorbidity explained only 1.9% of the variation in resection rates. For every 100 CVD comorbid patients, increasing resection in regions with the lowest rates from 24 to 44% would result in 16 more patients resected and alive after 1 year and two fewer deaths overall. Variation in regional resection rate is not explained by CVD comorbidities. Increasing resection in patients with CVD comorbidity to the levels of the highest resecting region would increase 1-year survival.},

Metrics are presented at both the individual and population level. Flexible parametric models were fitted to estimate life-expectancy metrics to be applied to a group of 104,938 subjects with a melanoma skin cancer diagnosis from 2000 to 2017. Period analysis was used for better predictions for newly diagnosed patients, and missing-stage information was imputed for 9918 patients. Female relative survival was assigned to male subjects to demonstrate the survival discrepancies experienced between sexes. At the age of 60, males diagnosed at the regional stage lose an average of 4.99 years of life compared to the general population, and females lose 4.79 years, demonstrating the sex variation in expected mortality. In 2017, males contributed 3545 more life years lost than females, and a potential 1931 life years could be preserved if sex differences in survival were eliminated. This study demonstrates the survival differences across population subgroups as a result of a melanoma cancer diagnosis. Females experience better prognosis across age and stage at diagnosis; however, further investigation is necessary to better understand the mechanisms behind this difference.},

The aim of this study was to examine whether these differences in outcome remain, based on updated information from five national cancer registers. The data used for the analysis was from the NORDCAN database focusing on nine common cancers diagnosed 1990-2016 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden with maximum follow-up through 2017. Relative survival (RS) was estimated at 1 and 5 years using flexible parametric RS models, and percentage point differences between the earliest and latest years available were calculated. A consistent improvement in both 1- and 5-year RS was found for most studied sites across all countries. Previously observed differences between the countries have been attenuated. The improvements were particularly pronounced in Denmark that now has cancer survival similar to the other Nordic countries. The reasons for the observed improvements in cancer survival are likely multifactorial, including earlier diagnosis, improved treatment options, implementation of national cancer plans, uniform national cancer care guidelines and standardized patient pathways. The previous survival disadvantage in Denmark is no longer present for most sites. Continuous monitoring of cancer survival is of importance to assess the impact of changes in policies and the effectiveness of health care systems.},

Life expectancy of patients diagnosed with breast, colon, and testicular cancers, stratified by age at diagnosis and time since diagnosis, is provided as an indicator to evaluate future mortality risks and health care needs of cancer survivors. The standard period life table methodology was applied to estimate excess mortality risk for cancer patients diagnosed in 1985-2011 from SEER registries and mortality data of the general US population. The sensitivity of life expectancy estimates on different assumptions was evaluated. Younger patients with colon cancer showed wider differences in life expectancy compared with that of the general population (11.2 years in women and 10.7 in men at age 45-49 years) than older patients (6.3 and 5.8 at age 60-64 years, respectively). Life expectancy progressively increases in patients surviving the first years, up to 4 years from diagnosis, and then starts to decrease again, approaching that of the general population. For breast cancer, the initial drop in life expectancy is less marked, and again with wider differences in younger patients, varying from 8.7 at age 40-44 years to 2.4 at ages 70-74 years. After diagnosis, life expectancy still decreases with time, but less than that in the general population, slowly approaching that of cancer-free women. Life expectancy of men diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 30 years is estimated as 45.2 years, 2 years less than cancer-free men of the same age. The difference becomes 1.3 years for patients surviving the first year, and then slowly approaches zero with increasing survival time. Life expectancy provides meaningful information on cancer patients, and can help in assessing when a cancer survivor can be considered as cured.},

  abstract        = {Quality-adjusted life year is widely applied nowadays, which consider both survival and quality of life (QoL). When most diseases are becoming chronic, it is imperative to quantify the overall health impact of a disease in lifetime perspective. The purpose of this study is to introduce methods for estimating quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and loss of QALE in patients with a disease or specific conditions. The QALE of an index cohort can be represented as the integration of the product of lifetime survival function and mean QoL function. We introduce a robust extrapolation approach for estimating lifetime survival function and propose an approach for estimating lifetime mean QoL function for studies with limited follow-up. The best part of the proposed method is that the survival data and QoL data can be collected separately. A cohort of patients with a specific condition can be identified by databases that regularly collect data for the control of diseases, and their survival status is verified by linking to a mortality registry. Although nationwide QoL data are not available, researchers can implement a relative short-term follow-up interview on a random sample of patients to collect QoL data. For demonstration, we applied the proposed methods to estimate QALE and loss of QALE of oral cancer patients. The estimates (95% confidence interval) of QALE for oral cancer patients were 11.0 (10.5-11.6) and 14.2 (12.7-15.5) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for men and women, respectively. The estimates of loss of QALE for the male and female patients with oral cancer were 14.4 (13.8-14.9) and 7.5 (6.2-9.0) QALYs, respectively. The methods for estimating QALE and loss of QALE can be applied to economic evaluation of cancer control, including screening.},

Kinase inhibitors (KI) are major therapeutic innovations for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and myelofibrosis (MF) providing a relevant improvement of quality-adjusted survival in patients with high-risk or refractory disease. CML patients are being treated with first-generation KI imatinib since many years, achieving expected survivals longer than 10 years. Second- and third generations KIs, such as nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib and bosutinib, recently expanded the therapeutic yield for CML and treatment discontinuation in patients with persistent deep molecular response is being pursued. Areas covered: This review summarizes available evidence on economic analyses of KI treatments for CML, CLL and MF aimed at identifying the key determinants of KI cost-effectiveness. Expert commentary: On converse, specific KIs for CLL and MF patients have been marketed only in the last few years. Ibrutinib and idelalisib allowed to improve the outcomes of relapsed/refractory CLL and of patients with poor genetic features, while the first-in-class JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib allowed to improve symptoms of advanced MF patients and to prolong survival in responders. In the current situation of healthcare budget restrictions worldwide, the value for cost of the above KIs has been questioned.},

  abstract        = {The number of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies increases. One component of HTAs are economic aspects. To incorporate economic aspects commonly economic evaluations are performed. A convergence of recommendations for methods of health economic evaluations between international HTA agencies would facilitate the adaption of results to different settings and avoid unnecessary expense. A first step in this direction is a detailed analysis of existing similarities and differences in recommendations to identify potential for harmonization. The objective is to provide an overview and comparison of the methodological recommendations of international HTA agencies for economic evaluations. The webpages of 127 international HTA agencies were searched for guidelines containing recommendations on methods for the preparation of economic evaluations. Additionally, the HTA agencies were requested information on methods for economic evaluations. Recommendations of the included guidelines were extracted in standardized tables according to 13 methodological aspects. All process steps were performed independently by two reviewers. Finally 25 publications of 14 HTA agencies were included in the analysis. Methods for economic evaluations vary widely. The greatest accordance could be found for the type of analysis and comparator. Cost-utility-analyses or cost-effectiveness-analyses are recommended. The comparator should continuously be usual care. Again the greatest differences were shown in the recommendations on the measurement/sources of effects, discounting and in the analysis of sensitivity. The main difference regarding effects is the focus either on efficacy or effectiveness. Recommended discounting rates range from 1.5%-5% for effects and 3%-5% for costs whereby it is mostly recommended to use the same rate for costs and effects. With respect to the analysis of sensitivity the main difference is that oftentimes the probabilistic or deterministic approach is recommended exclusively. Methods for modeling are only described vaguely and mainly with the rational that the "appropriate model" depends on the decision problem. Considering all other aspects a comparison is challenging as recommendations vary regarding detailedness and addressed issues. There is a considerable unexplainable variance in recommendations. Further effort is needed to harmonize methods for preparing economic evaluations.},

This point was made clear by Hernán (Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass) 21(1):13-15, 2010) in a commentary, which emphasised that the hazard ratio contrasts populations of treated and untreated individuals who survived a given period of time, populations that will typically fail to be comparable-even in a randomised trial-as a result of different pressures or intensities acting on different populations. The commentary has been very influential, but also a source of surprise and confusion. In this note, we aim to provide more insight into the subtle interpretation of hazard ratios and differences, by investigating in particular what can be learned about a treatment effect from the hazard ratio becoming 1 (or the hazard difference 0) after a certain period of time. We further define a hazard ratio that has a causal interpretation and study its relationship to the Cox hazard ratio, and we also define a causal hazard difference. These quantities are of theoretical interest only, however, since they rely on assumptions that cannot be empirically evaluated. Throughout, we will focus on the analysis of randomised experiments.},

For example, cardiovascular disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events, contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of interest or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not mediated by the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be represented in causal diagrams, in which competing events are depicted as time-varying covariates. We present an application of these ideas to data from a randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of estrogen therapy on prostate cancer mortality.},

Such applications include investigating the determinants that drive differences in cancer survival across subgroups. However, cancer disparities may be the result of complex mechanisms that involve both cancer-related and other-cause mortality differences making it difficult to identify the causing factors. Relative survival, a commonly used measure in cancer epidemiology, can be used to focus on cancer-related differences. We extended mediation analysis to the relative survival framework for exploring cancer inequalities. The marginal effects were obtained using regression standardization, after fitting a relative survival model. Contrasts of interests included both marginal relative survival and marginal all-cause survival differences between exposure groups. Such contrasts include the indirect effect due to a mediator that is identifiable under certain assumptions. A separate model was fitted for the mediator and uncertainty was estimated using parametric bootstrapping. The avoidable deaths under interventions can also be estimated to quantify the impact of eliminating differences. The methods are illustrated using data for individuals diagnosed with colon cancer. Mediation analysis within relative survival allows focus on factors that account for cancer-related differences instead of all-cause differences and helps improve our understanding on cancer inequalities.},

  abstract        = {As cancer patient survival improves, late effects from treatment are becoming the next clinical challenge. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, for example, potentially increase the risk of both morbidity and mortality from second malignancies and cardiovascular disease. To provide clinically relevant population-level measures of late effects, it is of importance to (1) simultaneously estimate the risks of both morbidity and mortality, (2) partition these risks into the component expected in the absence of cancer and the component due to the cancer and its treatment, and (3) incorporate the multiple time scales of attained age, calendar time, and time since diagnosis. Multistate models provide a framework for simultaneously studying morbidity and mortality, but do not solve the problem of partitioning the risks. However, this partitioning can be achieved by applying a relative survival framework, allowing us to directly quantify the excess risk. This article proposes a combination of these two frameworks, providing one approach to address (1) to (3). Using recently developed methods in multistate modeling, we incorporate estimation of excess hazards into a multistate model. Both intermediate and absorbing state risks can be partitioned and different transitions are allowed to have different and/or multiple time scales. We illustrate our approach using data on Hodgkin lymphoma patients and excess risk of diseases of the circulatory system, and provide user-friendly Stata software with accompanying example code.},

  abstract        = {Data from population-based cancer registries are often used to compare cancer survival between countries or regions. The ICBP SURVMARK-2 study is an international partnership aiming to quantify and explore the reasons behind survival differences across high-income countries. However, the magnitude and relevance of differences in cancer survival between countries have been questioned, as it is argued that observed survival variations may be explained, at least in part, by differences in cancer registration practice, completeness and the availability and quality of the respective data sources. As part of the ICBP SURVMARK-2 study, we used a simulation approach to better understand how differences in completeness, the characteristics of those missed and inclusion of cases found from death certificates can impact on cancer survival estimates. Bias in 1- and 5-year net survival estimates for 216 simulated scenarios is presented. Out of the investigated factors, the proportion of cases not registered through sources other than death certificates, had the largest impact on survival estimates. Our results show that the differences in registration practice between participating countries could in our most extreme scenarios explain only a part of the largest observed differences in cancer survival.},

  abstract        = {Multi-state models are being increasingly used to capture complex disease pathways. The convenient formula of the exponential multi-state model can facilitate a quick and accessible understanding of the data. However, assuming time constant transition rates is not always plausible. On the other hand, obtaining predictions from a fitted model with time-dependent transitions can be challenging. One proposed solution is to utilise a general simulation algorithm to calculate predictions from a fitted multi-state model. Predictions obtained from an exponential multi-state model were compared to those obtained from two different parametric models and to non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimates. The first comparative approach fitted a multi-state model with transition-specific distributions, chosen separately based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The second approach was a Royston-Parmar multi-state model with 4 degrees of freedom, which was chosen as a reference model flexible enough to capture complex hazard shapes. All quantities were obtained analytically for the exponential and Aalen-Johansen approaches. The transition rates for the two comparative approaches were also obtained analytically, while all other quantities were obtained from the fitted models via a general simulation algorithm. Metrics investigated were: transition probabilities, attributable mortality (AM), population attributable fraction (PAF) and expected length of stay. This work was performed on previously analysed hospital acquired infection (HAI) data. By definition, a HAI takes three days to develop and therefore selected metrics were also predicted from time 3 (delayed entry). Despite clear deviations from the constant transition rates assumption, the empirical estimates of the transition probabilities were approximated reasonably well by the exponential model. However, functions of the transition probabilities, e.g. AM and PAF, were not well approximated and the comparative models offered considerable improvements for these metrics. They also provided consistent predictions with the empirical estimates in the case of delayed entry time, unlike the exponential model. We conclude that methods and software are readily available for obtaining predictions from multi-state models that do not assume constant transition rates. The multistate package in Stata facilitates a range of predictions with confidence intervals, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data. User-friendly code is provided.},

  abstract        = {Population-based cancer registries strive to cover all cancer cases diagnosed within the population, but some cases will always be missed and no register is 100 % complete. Many cancer registries use death certificates to identify additional cases not captured through other routine sources, to hopefully add a large proportion of the missed cases. Cases notified through this route, who would not have been captured without death certificate information, are referred to as Death Certificate Initiated (DCI) cases. Inclusion of DCI cases in cancer registries increases completeness and is important for estimating cancer incidence. However, inclusion of DCI cases will generally lead to biased estimates of cancer survival, but the same is often also true if excluding DCI cases. Missed cases are probably not a random sample of all cancer cases, but rather cases with poor prognosis. Further, DCI cases have poorer prognosis than missed cases in general, since they have all died with cancer mentioned on the death certificates. We performed a simulation study to estimate the impact of including or excluding DCI cases on cancer survival estimates, under different scenarios. We demonstrated that including DCI cases underestimates survival. The exclusion of DCI cases gives unbiased survival estimates if missed cases are a random sample of all cancer cases, while survival is overestimated if these have poorer prognosis. In our most extreme scenarios, with 25 % of cases initially missed, the usual practice of including DCI cases underestimated 5-year survival by at most 3 percentage points.},

To adjust for confounding variables that contain too many combinations to be fully stratified, two model-based standardization methods exist: regression standardization and use of an inverse probability of exposure weighted-reweighted estimators. Whereas the former requires an outcome regression model conditional on exposure and confounders, the latter requires a propensity score model. In reconciling among their modeling assumptions, doubly robust estimators, which only require correct specification of either the outcome regression or the propensity score model but do not necessitate both, have been well studied for total populations. Here, we provide doubly robust estimators of standardized risk difference and ratio in the exposed population.

We used colon cancer incidence data for the period 2010 to 2014. We estimated the 3-year net survival, as well as the 3-year net survival conditional on surviving at least 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis, by country and stage at diagnosis (categorised as localised, regional or distant) using flexible parametric excess hazard regression models. In all countries, increasing age was associated with lower net survival. For example, 3-year net survival (95% confidence interval) was 81% (80-82) for 50 to 64 year olds and 58% (56-60) for 85 to 99 year olds in Australia, and 74% (73-74) and 39% (39-40) in the United Kingdom, respectively. Those with distant stage colon cancer had the largest difference in colon cancer survival between the youngest and the oldest patients. Excess mortality for the oldest patients with localised or regional cancers was observed during the first 6 months after diagnosis. Older patients diagnosed with localised (and in some countries regional) stage colon cancer who survived 6 months after diagnosis experienced the same survival as their younger counterparts. Further studies examining other prognostic clinical factors such as comorbidities and treatment, and socioeconomic factors are warranted to gain further understanding of the age disparities in colon cancer survival.},

Another goal is achieving a stable deep molecular response (DMR) and discontinuing medication for treatment-free remission (TFR). The European LeukemiaNet convened an expert panel to critically evaluate and update the evidence to achieve these goals since its previous recommendations. First-line treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; imatinib brand or generic, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are available first-line). Generic imatinib is the cost-effective initial treatment in CP. Various contraindications and side-effects of all TKIs should be considered. Patient risk status at diagnosis should be assessed with the new EUTOS long-term survival (ELTS)-score. Monitoring of response should be done by quantitative polymerase chain reaction whenever possible. A change of treatment is recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or when molecular milestones are not reached. Greater than 10% BCR-ABL1 at 3 months indicates treatment failure when confirmed. Allogeneic transplantation continues to be a therapeutic option particularly for advanced phase CML. TKI treatment should be withheld during pregnancy. Treatment discontinuation may be considered in patients with durable DMR with the goal of achieving TFR.},

  abstract        = {Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Decision-analytic modeling can help to extrapolate data from short-term clinical trials and also consider quality of life when evaluating different treatment strategies. Our goal was to describe and analyze the structural and methodological approaches of published decision-analytic models for various treatment strategies in CML and to derive recommendations for the development of future CML models. We performed a systematic literature search in electronic databases (MEDLINE/PreMEDLINE, EconLit, EMBASE, NHS EED, and Tuft's CEA Registry) to identify published studies evaluating CML treatment strategies using mathematical models. The search was updated in August 2013. The models were required to compare different treatment strategies in relation to relevant clinical and patient-relevant health outcomes [e.g., life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years] over a defined time horizon and population. We used standardized forms for data extraction, description of study design, methodological framework, and data sources for each model. We identified 18 different decision-analytic modeling studies. Of these, 17 included economic evaluations. Modeling approaches included decision trees, Markov cohort models, state-transition models with individual (Monte Carlo) simulations, and mathematical equations. Analytic time horizons ranged from 2 years to a lifetime. Treatment strategies compared included bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, conventional chemotherapy, interferon-α, and TKIs. Only one model evaluated a second-generation TKI. Most models did not report a model validation. All models conducted deterministic sensitivity analyses and four reported a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Articles that were not published in English or German were not included in this review. Our literature search was restricted to published full-text articles in certain databases. Therefore, publications that met our inclusion criteria but were published in different databases, different languages, or as abstracts only may have been missed. While several well-designed models of CML treatment strategies exist, there remains a need for the assessment of the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of novel treatment options such as second-generation TKIs. Additionally, these models should be validated using independent data.},

  abstract        = {Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a form of cancer affecting the blood, characterised by excessive proliferation of white blood cells in the bone marrow and circulating blood. In the UK, an estimated 560 new cases of CML are diagnosed each year. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in the treatment of people with imatinib-resistant (ImR) and imatinib-intolerant (ImI) CML. A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature, a review of manufacturer submissions and a critique and exploration of manufacturer submissions for accelerated phase and blast crisis CML were carried out and a decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in chronic phase CML. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODS: Key databases were searched for relevant studies from their inception to June 2009 [MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, (ISI Web of Science) Conference Proceedings Citation Index and four others]. One reviewer assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, with a sample checked by a second reviewer. The full text of relevant papers was obtained and screened against the full inclusion criteria independently by two reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Clinical effectiveness studies were synthesised through narrative review. ECONOMIC EVALUATION METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses reported in manufacturer submissions to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence were critically appraised and summarised narratively. In addition, the models for accelerated phase and blast crisis underwent a more detailed critique and exploration. Two separate decision-analytic models were developed for chronic phase CML, one simulating a cohort of individuals who have shown or developed resistance to normal dose imatinib and one representing individuals who have been unable to continue imatinib treatment owing to adverse events. One-way, multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore structural and parameter uncertainty. Fifteen studies were included in the systematic review. Chronic phase: effectiveness data were limited but dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic response and haematological response in both ImR and ImI populations. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it was extremely difficult to reach any conclusions regarding either agent in the ImR population. All three models (Novartis, PenTAG and Bristol-Myers Squibb) were seriously flawed in one way or another, as a consequence of the paucity of data appropriate to construct robust decision-analytic models. Accelerated and blast crisis: all available data originated from observational single-arm studies and there were considerable and potentially important differences in baseline characteristics which seriously undermined any process for making meaningful comparisons between treatments. Owing to a lack of available clinical data, de novo models of accelerated phase and blast crisis have not been developed. The economic evaluations carried out by the manufacturers of nilotinib and dasatinib were seriously undermined by the absence of evidence on high-dose imatinib in these populations. The study has been necessarily constrained by the paucity of available clinical data, the differences in definitions used in the studies and the subsequent impossibility of undertaking a meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses to inform all policy questions. Dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic and haematological responses in both ImR and ImI populations. It was difficult to reach any cost-effectiveness conclusions as a consequence of the paucity of the data. Future research should include a three-way, double-blind, randomised clinical trial of dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib.},

  abstract        = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with an incidence of 1-2 cases per 100 000 adults. It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene (ABL1) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with second generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses, but they had no impact on survival prolongation, likely because of the existence of highly effective salvage therapies for patients who have a cytogenetic relapse with frontline TKI. For CML post failure on frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although potent and selective, these exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I "gatekeeper" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for patients with CML-CP who have failed at least 2 TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease. Even among older patients who have a cytogenetic relapse post failure on all TKIs, they can maintain long-term survival if they continue on a daily most effective/less toxic TKI, with or without the addition of non-TKI anti-CML agents (hydroxyurea, omacetaxine, azacitidine, decitabine, cytarabine, busulfan, others).},

  abstract        = {Third-line treatment options for patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia include tyrosine kinase inhibitors and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The objective of this study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and Canada. Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada. Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively. Ponatinib may improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response rates and longer response durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with other third-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in Germany, Sweden, and Canada; however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a limitation of our study.},

With different states of disease, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is particularly suited for the application of multi-state models. In this article, we tried to find a model for CML that allows predicting the prevalence of three different states (initial state of disease, remission and progression) in dependence on treatment, adjusted for age, sex and risk score. Based on the German CML Study IV, one of the largest randomised studies in CML, the model was able to represent the known effects of age and risk score on the probabilities of remission and progression. Patients achieving a major molecular remission had a better chance of surviving without progression, but this effect was not significant. Comparing treatments, patient of the high-dose arm had the greatest chance to be in the state "remission" at 5 years but did not seem to have an advantage considering "progression". The proposed illness-death model can be useful for predicting the course of CML based on the patient's individual covariates (trial registration: this is an explorative analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00055874).},

  abstract        = {Treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukaemia-ie, achievement of a sustained deep molecular response leading to discontinuation of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy-has become a potential aim of therapy. Highly priced second-generation TKIs might offer deep molecular response status more quickly and for more patients than imatinib; however, with the availability and lower cost of generic imatinib, the value of second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy for this particular treatment endpoint remains unknown. We aimed to assess the potential value of second-generation TKIs used as frontline therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase in relation to the probability of achieving sustained deep molecular responses compared with generic imatinib, and the associated cost of each modality. We used a decision analytic model to consider the value of different TKI approaches from the payer's perspective. The proportion of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response after 5 years of treatment in chronic phase was estimated at 26% with imatinib and 44% with second-generation TKIs. We also modelled more favourable scenarios of the proportion of patients achieving such response with second-generation TKIs at 66%, 88%, and a near-perfect response of 99%. For each scenario, we examined the impact of the combination of health utilities for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (base case 0·89, range 0-1) and the annual cost of second-generation TKIs (base case US$152 814 [ie, the price of nilotinib in the USA], range 0-240 000) on the cost-effectiveness of second-generation TKIs compared with generic imatinib. We used different price scenarios for generic imatinib in the USA (average price $35 000 per year; lowest price $4400 per year), Europe ($4000 per year), and developing countries ($2100 per year). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and assessed cost-effectiveness by considering two societal willingness-to-pay thresholds: $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in all markets and $200 000 per QALY in the USA. In the base case, we obtained an ICER of $22 765 208, meaning that second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy to achieve sustained deep molecular response was not cost-effective under either of the societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. In our sensitivity analyses, none of the explored scenarios showed potential treatment value for use of second-generation TKIs at the current prices in the USA or at the price of $30 000-40 000 per year elsewhere. For example, considering a scenario in the USA using second-generation TKIs versus imatinib (annual price $4400 per year) with the potential benefit in favour of second-generation TKI (willingness to pay $200 000 per QALY, 66% of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response, and health utility of the chronic phase of 0·1), the cost of second-generation TKIs would need to be less than $25 000 per year to be a cost-effective option. Under the same conditions in developing nations, with a price of generic imatinib of $2100 per year and a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, the annual price of second-generation TKIs should not exceed $10 000 per year of therapy. Considering the current prices of second-generation TKIs and of generic imatinib under different pricing scenarios in the USA, Europe, and developing countries, second-generation TKIs at current prices do not offer good value as frontline therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia in order to achieve sustained deep molecular response and treatment-free remission.

The objective of this study was to compare overall survival (OS) between patients with CML and those with Ph+ ALL who received treatment with ponatinib versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). A post hoc, retrospective, indirect comparison of OS among patients who received single-agent ponatinib in the Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial with those who underwent allo-SCT as reported to the European Bone Marrow Transplant registry, stratified by CML disease phase and Ph+ ALL, was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models were used to compare OS between intervention groups, adjusting for time from diagnosis to intervention, age, sex, and geographic region; 24-month and 48-month OS rates and median OS were reported. After adjustment for potential confounders, 24-month and 48-month OS rates were significantly higher in patients with chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) who received ponatinib compared with those who underwent allo-SCT (24 months: 84% vs 60.5%, respectively; P = .004; 48 months: 72.7% vs 55.8%, respectively; P = .013), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.84; P = .017). In patients who had accelerated-phase CML, OS rates were not significantly different between the groups (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.20-4.10; P = .889). In patients who had blast-crisis CML and those with Ph+ ALL, ponatinib was associated with shorter OS compared with allo-SCT (blast-crisis CML: HR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.08-4.82; P = .030]; Ph+ ALL: HR, 2.77 [95% CI, 0.73-10.56; P = .146]). Although allo-SCT remains an important treatment option for patients with T315I-positive advanced CML and Ph+ ALL, ponatinib represents a valuable alternative for patients with T315I-positive CP-CML.

  abstract        = {Imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec) has largely supplanted allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as first line therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Nevertheless, many people with CML eventually undergo HCT, raising the question of whether prior IM therapy impacts HCT success. Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research on 409 subjects treated with IM before HCT (IM(+)) and 900 subjects who did not receive IM before HCT (IM(-)) were analyzed. Among patients in first chronic phase, IM therapy before HCT was associated with better survival but no statistically significant differences in treatment-related mortality, relapse, and leukemia-free survival. Better HLA-matched donors, use of bone marrow, and transplantation within one year of diagnosis were also associated with better survival. A matched-pairs analysis was performed and confirmed a higher survival rate among first chronic phase patients receiving IM. Among patients transplanted with advanced CML, use of IM before HCT was not associated with treatment-related mortality, relapse, leukemia-free survival, or survival. Acute graft-versus-host disease rates were similar between IM(+) and IM(-) groups regardless of leukemia phase. These results should be reassuring to patients receiving IM before HCT.},

  abstract        = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was the first human malignancy to be associated with a specific genetic lesion, the Philadelphia chromosome, harboring the BCR-ABL oncogene. Since then, it has become a paradigm for the discovery of molecular mechanisms and targeted therapeutic approaches in the field of hematologic neoplasias. The past 5 years or so have been particularly fruitful in the dissection of the signal transduction pathways abnormally activated in CML and in the translation of this knowledge to clinical practice. In this report, we discuss the biological basis for such translation and highlight the current and potential tools for the effective treatment of CML patients. The first part presents a review of the basic concepts on the biology of CML and their application to the design of targeted therapy. The mechanisms of action of the molecular-specific drugs currently used in clinical trials are discussed, with emphasis on the description of the most promising new compounds that are enhancing the potential for effective alternative or combination chemotherapy in CML. In the following section, we explain how molecular monitoring of response to imatinib mesylate in patients with CML can be used as a guide to clinical management. In particular, we discuss the relative value of regular quantitative RT/PCR and cytogenetic analyses, how responding patients should be monitored and managed, and how to investigate patients who are refractory or become resistant to imatinib treatment. In the last part of this report, a discussion on the possibility of managing CML with patient-specific strategies is presented. We review the current treatment options, highlight the factors impacting on decision making, discuss the range of possibilities for future therapeutic strategies and propose a systematic approach for individualizing treatment for patients in different disease categories.},

  abstract        = {The present study examined the median survival, life expectancies, and cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) stratified by different underlying diseases. According to the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, there were 8,906,406 individuals who obtained respiratory care during the period from 1997 to 2007. A random sample of this population was performed, and subjects who had continuously undergone mechanical ventilation for longer than 21 days were enrolled in the current study. Annual incidence rates and the CIR were calculated. After stratifying the patients according to their specific diagnoses, latent class analysis was performed to categorise PMV patients with multiple co-morbidities into several groups. The life expectancies of different groups were estimated using a semiparametric method with a hazard function based on the vital statistics of Taiwan. The analysis of 50,481 PMV patients revealed that incidence rates increased as patients grew older and that the CIR (17 to 85 years old) increased from 0.103 in 1998 to 0.183 in 2004 before stabilising thereafter. The life expectancies of PMV patients suffering from degenerative neurological diseases, stroke, or injuries tended to be longer than those with chronic renal failure or cancer. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease survived longer than did those co-morbid with other underlying diseases, especially septicaemia/shock. PMV provides a direct means to treat respiratory tract diseases and to sustain respiration in individuals suffering from degenerative neurological diseases, and individuals with either of these types of conditions respond better to PMV than do those with other co-morbidities. Future research is required to determine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment paradigm.},

  abstract        = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) management changed dramatically with the development of imatinib mesylate (IM), the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. In Sweden, the drug was approved in November 2001. We report relative survival (RS) of patients with CML diagnosed during a 36-year period. Using data from the population-based Swedish Cancer Registry and population life tables, we estimated RS for all patients diagnosed with CML from 1973 to 2008 (n = 3173; 1796 males and 1377 females; median age, 62 years). Patients were categorized into five age groups and five calendar periods, the last being 2001 to 2008. Information on use of upfront IM was collected from the Swedish CML registry. Relative survival improved with each calendar period, with the greatest improvement between 1994-2000 and 2001-2008. Five-year cumulative relative survival ratios (95% CIs) were 0.21 (0.17 to 0.24) for patients diagnosed 1973-1979, 0.54 (0.50 to 0.58) for 1994-2000, and 0.80 (0.75 to 0.83) for 2001-2008. This improvement was confined to patients younger than 79 years of age. Five-year RSRs for patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.94) and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.47) for patients younger than 50 and older than 79 years, respectively. Men had inferior outcome. Upfront overall use of IM increased from 40% (2002) to 84% (2006). Only 18% of patients older than 80 years of age received IM as first-line therapy. This large population-based study shows a major improvement in outcome of patients with CML up to 79 years of age diagnosed from 2001 to 2008, mainly caused by an increasing use of IM. The elderly still have poorer outcome, partly because of a limited use of IM.},

  abstract        = {Clinical management guidelines on malignant disorders are generally based on data from clinical trials with selected patient cohorts. In Sweden, more than 95% of all patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are reported to the national CML registry, providing unique possibilities to compile population-based information. This report is based on registry data from 2002 to 2010, when a total of 779 patients (425 men, 354 women; median age, 60 years) were diagnosed with CML (93% chronic, 5% accelerated, and 2% blastic phase) corresponding to an annual incidence of 0.9/100,000. In 2002, approximately half of the patients received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as initial therapy, a proportion that increased to 94% for younger (<70 years) and 79% for older (>80 years) patients during 2007-2009. With a median follow-up of 61 months, the relative survival at 5 years was close to 1.0 for patients younger than 60 years and 0.9 for those aged 60 to 80 years, but only 0.6 for those older than 80 years. At 12 months, 3% had progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. Sokal, but not European Treatment and Outcome Study, high-risk scores were significantly linked to inferior overall and relative survival. Patients living in university vs nonuniversity catchment areas more often received tyrosine kinase inhibitors up front but showed comparable survival.},

  abstract        = {Purpose Imatinib (IM) can safely be discontinued in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who have had undetectable minimal residual disease (UMRD) for at least 2 years. We report the final results of the Stop Imatinib (STIM1) study with a long follow-up. Patients and Methods IM was prospectively discontinued in 100 patients with CML with UMRD sustained for at least 2 years. Molecular recurrence (MR) was defined as positivity of BCR-ABL transcript in a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed by a second analysis point that indicated an increase of one log in relation to the first analysis point at two successive assessments or loss of major molecular response at one point. Results The median molecular follow-up after treatment discontinuation was 77 months (range, 9 to 95 months). Sixty-one patients lost UMRD after a median of 2.5 months (range, 1 to 22 months), and one patient died with UMRD at 10 months. Molecular recurrence-free survival was 43% (95% CI, 33% to 52%) at 6 months and 38% (95% CI, 29% to 47%) at 60 months. Treatment was restarted in 57 of 61 patients with MR, and 55 patients achieved a second UMRD with a median time of 4 months (range, 1 to 16 months). None of the patients experienced a CML progression. Analyses of the characteristics of the study population identified that the Sokal risk score and duration of IM treatment were significantly associated with the probability of MR. Conclusion With a median follow-up of more than 6 years after treatment discontinuation, the STIM1 study demonstrates that IM can safely be discontinued in patients with a sustained deep molecular response with no late MR.},

  abstract        = {Although a wealth of efficacy and safety data is available for many tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), there is a dearth of information on their impact on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate HRQOL and fatigue outcomes in patients with CML receiving first-line therapy with nilotinib. This was a multicenter, prospective study enrolling 130 patients with chronic-phase CML. HRQOL and fatigue were evaluated with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its validated Fatigue module at the baseline and then at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary prespecified HRQOL endpoints defined in the study protocol for longitudinal analysis were the Physical Functioning, Social Functioning, Role Functioning, and Fatigue scales. The remaining scales were investigated on an exploratory basis. The rate of baseline compliance with the HRQOL assessment was 95.4% (124 of 130), and the rate of overall compliance with HRQOL forms was 91%. Among the 4 prespecified primary HRQOL endpoints, statistically significant improvements over time were found for Physical Functioning (P = .013), Role Functioning (P = .004), and Fatigue (P < .001). Clinically meaningful improvements were found already 3 months after the treatment start. The baseline patient self-reported fatigue severity was an independent predictive factor for the achievement of a major molecular response with an odds ratio of 0.960 (95% confidence interval, 0.934-0.988; P = .005). For most patients, HRQOL improvements with nilotinib occur during the early phase of therapy and are maintained over time. Also, a more systematic HRQOL evaluation during the diagnostic workup of CML may help to predict clinical outcomes. Cancer 2018;124:2228-37. © 2018 American Cancer Society.},

After 24 months of treatment, 112/122 patients (91·8%) had a molecular assessment, 95·5% of whom achieved a major molecular response (MMR), 32·1% achieved uMR  , defined as an undetectable molecular disease with 4-log molecular response sensitivity (≥10 000 ABL1 transcripts). The Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale was completed by 94/122 patients (77·0%), and 89·4% of these patients obtained a satisfactory level of treatment adherence, defined as a score ≥3. Patients' QoL was good at baseline and stable during the follow-up period. The two most common nilotinib-related adverse events (AEs) were pruritus (14·8%) and asthenia (13·7%). Seven patients (3·8%) experienced at least one cardiovascular ischaemic AE.

  abstract        = {Patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) can be effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and achieve a lifespan similar to the general population. The success of TKIs, however, requires long-term and sometimes lifelong treatment; thus, patient-assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has become an increasingly important parameter for treatment selection. Bosutinib is a TKI approved for CP CML in newly diagnosed adults and in those resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. In the Bosutinib Trial in First-Line Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment (BFORE), bosutinib demonstrated a significantly higher major molecular response rate compared with imatinib, with maintenance of HRQoL (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) questionnaire), after 12 months of first-line treatment. We examined relationships between molecular response (MR) and HRQoL. MR values were represented by a log-reduction scale (MRLR; a continuous variable). A repeated-measures longitudinal model was used to estimate the relationships between MRLR as a predictor and each FACT-Leu domain as an outcome. Effect sizes were calculated to determine strength of effects and allow comparisons across domains. The majority of FACT-Leu domains (with the exception of social well-being and physical well-being) demonstrated a significant relationship with MRLR (p < 0.05). Our results showed variable impact of clinical improvement on different dimensions of HRQoL. For patients who achieved MR , emotional well-being and leukemia-specific domains showed the greatest improvement, with medium differences in effect sizes, whereas social well-being and physical well-being had the weakest relationship with MR.},

Imatinib can cause chronic side effects which are not considered serious but can impact the quality of life (QoL) of the patient. The results of a detailed symptom burden analysis and its impact on QoL scores in a cohort of patients on long-term imatinib is presented in this study. Symptom burden was assessed using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory specific for CML patients. An indigenously developed QoL questionnaire (Cancer Institute Quality of Life II) was administered simultaneously. Of 221 patients of CML (M:F = 133:88; median age: 39 years [18-65], median duration of imatinib: 4 years), QoL scores were high in 46%, average in 39%, and low in 14%. QoL scores were negatively correlated with general symptoms (  = -0.612,   < 0.001), CML-specific symptoms (  = -0.513,   < 0.001), and interference of symptoms (  = -0.596,   < 0.001). Significant impairment of QoL was noted among patients with CML primarily due to the burden of symptom related to side effects of imatinib. This issue must be addressed both in the clinic as well as in all studies of CML.},

  abstract        = {Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We aimed to assess health state utility and quality of life (QoL) in French patients with CML in real-life setting, to study the determinants of utility score and to compare health-related QoL values to general population norms. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 412 patients with CML. Data were collected by electronic survey. Three patient-reported outcomes questionnaires were used: EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-CML24 and EuroQol EQ-5D-3L. Health state utility values were computed using the French value set. We computed deviations from reference norms from the general population. We studied the determinants of health utility score using multiple regression models. The mean utility score (SD) was 0.72 (0.25) in the chronic phase and 0.84 (0.21) in treatment-free remission, with marked variations by gender. Patients with CML had a deviation from the reference norm of -0.15 on average (SD: 0.25). In terms of QoL, social functioning, role functioning and cognitive functioning were notably impacted with a mean difference of -16.0, -13.1 and -11.7 respectively. Fatigue, dyspnea and pain were the symptoms with the highest deviation from general population norms (mean difference of 20.6, 14.0 and 8.3 respectively). In the multiple regression analysis, fatigue was the most important independent predictor of the utility score. Although TKIs prevent the disease from progressing and even allow remission without treatment, QoL in patients with CML is notably altered. The utility scores deteriorate with CML symptoms.},

For these patients, the only alternative is to assume TKI continuously, lifelong. The Italian phase III multicentric randomized OPTkIMA study started in 2015, with the aim to evaluate if a progressive de-escalation of TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) is able to maintain the molecular response (MR  ) and to improve Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Up to December 2018, 166/185 (90%) elderly CML patients in stable MR  /MR  completed the first year of any TKI intermittent schedule 1 month ON and 1 month OFF. The first year probability of maintaining the MR  was 81% and 23.5% of the patients who lost the molecular response regained the MR  after resuming TKI continuously. Patients' HRQoL at baseline was better than that of matched peers from healthy population. Women was the only factor independently associated with worse baseline HRQoL (p > 0.0001). Overall, global HRQoL worsened at 6 (p < 0.001) but returned to the baseline value at 12 months and it was statistically significantly worse in women (p = 0.001). De-escalation of any TKI by 1 month ON/OFF schedule maintains the MR  /MR  in 81% of the patients during the first 12-24 months. No patients progressed to accelerated/blastic phase, all the patients (23.5%) losing MR  regained the MR  and none suffered from TKI withdrawn syndrome. The study firstly report on HRQoL in elderly CML patients moving from a continuous daily therapy to a de-escalated intermittent treatment.},

We performed an international study including 782 CML patients to assess the validity of the EORTC QLQ-CML 24 questionnaire, and to generate HRQOL reference values to facilitate interpretation of results in future studies. Internal consistency, assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficients, ranged from 0.66 to 0.83.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the QoL and symptom burden in patients receiving original imatinib, generic imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. A total of 121 patients with CML who received TKIs for at least 3 months were enrolled in the study. The QoL was assessed with the Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (QLQ-CML24) modules. The symptom burden was assessed with MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) and EORTC QLQ-CML24. The median age of the study population was 53 years (range, 28-90 years), and 83 (81.4%) patients had a low-to-medium Sokal risk score. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of most patients were good (< 2; 96%), and comorbidity scores were low (HCT-CI < 3; 90.8%). There was no significant difference between the general health status of patients in terms of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CML24. According to the results of the MDASI-CML and QLQ-CML24 modules, the most common symptom was fatigue (58.7%) in all groups, and there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the effects on the daily life activities of the patients. Patients with CML receiving first- and second-generation TKIs were seen to have a similar QoL and symptom burden.},

A prospective, longitudinal, single-center study was conducted to assess the response to treatment with imatinib or nilotinib and the HRQoL profile of patients who were newly diagnosed with CML in chronic phase enrolled in the ENESTchina study. Fifty-nine patients were randomized to receive imatinib (n = 31) or nilotinib (n = 28). With a median follow-up of 5 years, there was no difference in HRQoL profile observed between patients receiving imatinib and nilotinib. Achieving optimal response at 12 months was associated with better role limitations due to physical health problems (RP; P = 0.0019) and emotional problems (RE; P = 0.0110) and was the sole factor associated with significantly improving physical component summary over time (PCS; P = 0.0160). Achieving optimal response at 6 months had high probability of better physical functioning (PF; P = 0.0674), better social functioning (SF; P = 0.0571), and reduced role limitations due to emotional problems (RE; P = 0.0916). In addition, factors including age < 40 years, female gender, and higher level of education were also associated with better HRQoL subscale scores. However, optimal response at 3 months had no impact on HRQoL profile. The proportions of patients with failure-free survival and PFS at 5 years were significantly higher among patients who achieved optimal response at 3, 6, or 12 months than among those who did not achieve optimal response (warning or failure), and the OS rate at 5 years was significantly higher among those who achieved optimal response at 12 months. In a multivariate analysis, treatment received (nilotinib vs imatinib) was identified as an independent factor for the achievement of optimal response at both 6 months (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.0-14.9) and 12 months (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-17.9).

A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to adults with chronic-phase CML receiving tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) therapy >3 months in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR). Respondents were anonymous. SF-36 Health Survey was used to measure HRQoL. Data from 828 respondents were analyzable. 524 (63%) were male. Median age was 42 years (range 18-88 years). 648 (78%) were receiving imatinib. Median TKI-therapy duration was 36 months (range 3-178 months). 638 (77%) paid some or all of their TKI costs. Annual out-of-pocket expenses >$4600 USD was associated with lower physical component summary (PCS; -2.8 to -3.8; P = 0.0081 and 0.0009) and mental component summary (MCS; -2.1 to -4.3; P = 0.0394 and 0.0080) in multivariate analyses. Other variables significantly associated with a lower PCS and/or MCS included: (1) female sex; (2) increasing age; (3) education level < bachelor degree; (4) co-morbidity(ies); and (5) generic drug use. TKI-therapy duration 3-5 years was associated with higher PCS and MCS. Higher out-of-pocket expense for TKI therapy is significantly associated with worse HRQoL in persons with chronic-phase CML in CCyR receiving TKI therapy. These data indicate the importance of drug cost and health insurance policies on people's HRQoL.},

Several reports indicated the advantage of continue long-term adherence associated with positive outcome. Therefore, it is important to better understand from the patient's standpoint the experience of living with the disease and the related treatment. In this study, quantitative analysis and narrative medicine were combined to get insights on this issue in a population of 257 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with TKIs (43 % men, with a median age of 58 years, 27 % aged 31-50 years), followed for a median time of 5 years. Sixty-one percent of patients enrolled were treated in first line, whereas 37 % were treated in second line. The results showed more positive perceptions and acceptance in males compared to females, without impact of disease on relationships. Level of positive acceptance was more evident in elderly compared to younger patients, with a close connection with median time from diagnosis. Overall, female patients reported negative perceptions and an impact of disease on family daily living. The majority of patients understood the importance of continue adherence to treatment, with 27 % resulting less adherent (60 % for forgetfulness), even if well informed and supported by his/her physician. Narrative medicine, in association to quantitative analysis, can help physicians to understand needs of their patients in order to improve communication.},

  abstract        = {The tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) bosutinib has demonstrated activity in patients with advanced phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remain unexplored. This study evaluated HRQoL in advanced CML patients receiving bosutinib in an ongoing phase 2 study following resistance or intolerance to prior imatinib therapy. This analysis included data from 76 accelerated-phase (AP) and 64 blast-phase (BP) patients resistant/intolerant to prior imatinib with or without prior exposure to other TKIs. Patient-reported HRQoL assessments completed at baseline; weeks 4, 8, and 12; every 12 weeks thereafter; and at treatment completion included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu); general health status was assessed using the 5-item EuroQol (EQ-5D) instrument and a visual analog scale (VAS). HRQoL at baseline was somewhat worse in BP versus AP CML patients. There was a significant improvement in the mean FACT-Leu Total scale at weeks 24, 36, and 48 in AP CML patients and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 96 in BP CML patients compared with baseline. EQ-5D Utility scores were stable throughout treatment in AP CML patients but significantly improved versus baseline in BP CML patients at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 36. Mean VAS scores were significantly improved at weeks 8, 36, and 48 in AP CML patients and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 96 in BP CML patients. The lack of a comparison group limits attribution of improvements in HRQoL specifically to bosutinib treatment; potential bias due to non-ignorable dropout may limit the ability to generalize these findings to situations where durations of therapy exceed the 96-week follow-up duration of the present study. These findings suggest that bosutinib therapy is associated with improved HRQoL in advanced phase CML patients. NCT00261846.},

A sample of 174 CML patients aged 60 years or above was analyzed. HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). A number of pre-selected sociodemographic and disease-related factors were considered as potential confounding factors for the association between comorbidity and HRQOL. Mean age of the 174 patients analyzed was 70 years (range 60-87 years) and 55 % were male. Overall, 111 patients (64 %) reported at least one comorbidity. Analysis stratified by age group category showed a greater proportion of patients with comorbidities in the older sub-group population (≥70 years) compared to younger patients (60 to 69 years). Differences in HRQOL outcomes between patients with no comorbidity at all and those with two or more comorbid conditions were at least twice the magnitude of a clinically meaningful difference in all the physical and mental health scales of the SF-36. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for key confounding factors, the following scales were significantly lower in those with comorbidity: general health (p < 0.001), bodily pain (p < 0.001), physical functioning (p = 0.002), and vitality (p = 0.002). Assessing comorbidity in elderly patients with CML is important to facilitate identification of those most in need of HRQOL improvements.},

Eighty-six adult, chronic-phase CML patients who had been on TKI treatment (79% on imatinib, 10.5% dasatinib, and 10.5% nilotinib) for at least 6 months participated in the study (mean age: 57.8 years, 52% males). The mean time from diagnosis was 5.1 years. All patients were interviewed, and patient-reported ADRs were obtained using a structured list. Adherence was assessed using Morisky's 8-item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS). The symptoms' interference with patient's daily QoL was measured by asking patients about the influence of symptom(s) on their mood, general condition, enjoyment of life, walking, relationships, and work. Ninety-seven percent of the patients were suffering from at least one ADR. The mean number of different symptoms was seven (range: 0-15, median 6). The most commonly perceived ADRs were muscle soreness or cramp (69/86, 80%); swelling of hands, legs, feet, or around the eyes (59/86, 69%); and fatigue (43/86, 50%). No correlation was found between adherence and ADRs, because symptoms were equally common in each MMAS adherence class. Half of the patients felt that the ADRs had a negative influence on their daily QoL. A quarter of the patients reported that ADRs affected either their mood, general condition, or enjoyment of life. The incidence of almost all ADRs was much higher among patients reporting negative influence of ADRs on their daily life compared to total study population (P=0.016). TKI-related ADRs were common among CML patients irrespective of patient's adherence level. Patients who reported that ADRs had a negative influence on their daily QoL perceived more ADRs than those who did not experience a negative influence.},

Between 2008 and 2010, patients with CML were surveyed by telephone. Quality of life was evaluated by the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) tool. The mean QOL among CML patients was 92.53 (out of 124 total points) in the trial outcome index, 78.50 (out of 108) in the general total score, and 130.43 (out of 176) in the leukemia total score. Patients who had the prescriptions recently changed anyway had better QOL general score (p = 0.012) and leukemia-specific score (p = 0.043) than those who remained with the same treatment. Imatinib was not associated with this change in QOL (p > 0.797). The more the patient felt able to work, the higher the scores in all three FACIT scales (p < 0.001, Spearman's correlation). The use of imatinib (p = 0.012) was associated with a better ability to work, while chemotherapy (p = 0.017) and the use of hydroxyurea (p = 0.001) were inversely associated with work capability. A recent change in medication can improve quality of life. The ability to work is an important component of quality of life of patients with CML. Ability to work should be specifically considered in CML treatment.},

A total of 222 patients including 126 and 96 in the imatinib and ISD HSCT groups, respectively, were enrolled. HRQOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. The ISD HSCT group functioned significantly better on the role-physical functioning and mental health subscales, as well as the mental component summary (MCS) than the imatinib group. HRQOL was generally comparable to groups in the young population. Multivariate analysis showed that white blood cell count ≥ 30 × 10(9)/L and plts count ≥ 450 × 10(9)/L were the major adverse factors affecting HRQOL in long-term survivors. Imatinib therapy was also an adverse factor affecting the MCS (odds ratio=1.7, P=0.032). Thus, long-term CML-CP1 survivors receiving ISD HSCT can attain desirable HRQOL comparable to or better than that of patients receiving imatinib.},

  abstract        = {Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a key aspect for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. The aim of this study was to develop a disease-specific HRQOL questionnaire for patients with CML to supplement the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ C30. The process followed a predefined and systematic stepwise iterative process as defined by the EORTC guidelines for questionnaire development. The process was divided into 3 phases: (1) generation of relevant HRQOL issues, (2) operationalization of the HRQOL issues into a set of items, and (3) pretesting the questionnaire for relevance and acceptability. Descriptive statistics and psychometric analyses were also performed. Overall, 655 CML patients were enrolled in 10 countries including the USA and countries in Europe and Asia. Interviews with health-care professionals experienced in CML (n = 59) were also conducted. Results from the interviews, clinical experiences, and statistical analyses were used to develop the EORTC QLQ-CML24. The final module consists of 24 items assessing the following aspects: symptom burden, impact on daily life and on worry/mood, body image problems, and satisfaction with care and with social life. Internal consistency, assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficients, ranged from 0.73 to 0.83 for the proposed scales. The EORTC QLQ-CML24 is an internationally developed HRQOL questionnaire for CML patients, and its implementation in clinical research and practice can provide important information to facilitate clinical decision-making.},

Furthermore, the potential for adverse events with longer-term therapy may result in dose adjustments, treatment discontinuation, or nonadherence, all of which may negatively affect treatment efficacy and QoL. However, instruments to specifically measure the impact of symptom burden and treatment on health-related QoL in patients with CML have not been widely available until recently. The FACT-Leu is a validated tool that measures leukemia-specific and more general QoL concerns. Other tools specific to CML, including the MDASI-CML and the EORTC QLQ-CML24, are undergoing validation. Here, we describe TKI therapy-related symptom burden and its effect on adherence and treatment response, outline instruments to measure symptom burden and QoL in CML, and summarize the available clinical data on QoL of patients on TKI therapy. QoL is an aspect of CML disease management that will continue to gain prominence in the coming years. We believe that the instruments developed now will have a role in informing treatment decisions in routine practice and allowing clinicians to proactively address issues related to symptom burden and QoL.},

  abstract     = {Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic disorder caused by acquired genetic defect in pluripotent stem cells characterized by acquisition of the philadelphia chromosome. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and quality of life (QoL) in CML patients treated with imatinib or hydroxyurea. A prospective observational study was conducted on 40 patients with pathologically confirmed CML in an in-patient department of Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and Research Centre (tertiary care cancer hospital) in India. Patients were divided into two groups (group A: Imatinib consuming patients and group B: Hydroxyurea consuming patients). Complete blood count was done every month to assess the efficacy and safety/toxicity profile of these drugs. The results were analyzed 12 months after completion of treatment. QoL was assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire core 30. Hematological response was analyzed using kaplan-meier survival analysis. Chi-square test was applied to assess the association of two regimens with complete hematological response, hematological and non-hematological toxicity. White blood cell (WBC) was noted each month in every patient of each group and analyzed by generalized linear mode (repeated measures) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Independent t-test was used to compare changes in QoL between treatment groups. At the end of treatment, significant improvement (P = 0.001) in hematological response was observed in the group A (95%) compared to group B (30%). WBC count analyzed at each month of treatment by ANOVA achieved better results for patients treated with imatinib (P = 0.0001). The hematological toxicity was higher in imatinib group while non-hematological toxicity was higher in the hydroxyurea group; however only little toxicities such as nausea and constipation were statistically significant. QoL assessment of patients related to functional scale showed significantly better results in group A (P = 0.046). The study showed that imatinib has better profile compared to hydroxyurea, with siginificant statistical differences in terms of efficacy, non-hematological toxicity and QoL in CML patients. Even with such better efficacy and safety profile, pharmacoeconomic evaluation needs to be done to justify and support the use of imatinib for CML patients in India.},

The main objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with long-term HRQOL outcomes of CML patients receiving imatinib. Analysis was performed on 422 CML patients recruited in an observational multicenter study. HRQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Key socio-demographic and clinical data were investigated for their association with HRQOL outcomes. Chronic fatigue and social support were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with HRQOL outcomes. Fatigue was the only variable showing an independent and consistent association across all physical and mental HRQOL outcomes (P<0.01). Differences between patients reporting low versus high fatigue levels were more than eight and seven times the magnitude of a clinically meaningful difference, respectively, for the role physical (Δ=70 points) and emotional scale (Δ=63 points) of the SF-36. Fatigue did not occur as an isolated symptom and was most highly correlated with musculoskeletal pain (r=0.511; P≤0.001) and muscular cramps (r=0.448; P≤0.001). Chronic fatigue is the major factor limiting HRQOL of CML patients receiving imatinib.},

This study compared CML patients taking a TKI for an average of 4.01 years (range 0.50-9.79 years) to age- and gender-matched controls with no history of cancer on measures of symptom burden, depression, fatigue, sleep, and health-related QOL. Compared to controls (n = 62), CML patients (n = 62) taking a TKI (imatinib 55 %, nilotinib 31 %, and dasatinib 14 %) reported significantly worse fatigue severity (p < .001), fatigue interference (p < .001), depression (p = .007), symptom burden (p < .001), and physical QOL (p < .001). TKI patients were also more likely meet established cutoffs for clinically meaningful fatigue (p values < .001) and depression (p = .004). There were no differences in mental QOL or sleep (p values > .010). Regarding specific symptoms, TKI patients were more likely to report nausea, diarrhea, itching, skin changes, swelling of arms or legs, and not looking like themselves (p values < .001). These data suggest the need for interventions to address QOL in CML patients taking TKIs.},

An additional sample of 99 CML patients, completing an online interview, was considered for supportive analyses. A sample of 59 HCPs from 12 countries also participated in the study. Patients and HCPs were asked to rate and rank the importance of a predefined list of 74 HRQOL aspects of potential relevance for CML patients. Patients and HCPs agreed that the following five aspects are most important: fatigue, muscle cramps, swelling, worries, and uncertainty about health condition in the future, and importance of social support in coping with the disease. However, the difference in rankings between the two groups was substantial with respect to other HRQOL aspects investigated. Patients valued some issues related to symptoms much higher than HCPs, thus suggesting that a better symptom management could be the crucial aspects to improve HRQOL of CML patients.},

  abstract        = {Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) might be crucial in comparing effectiveness of treatments as they could provide invaluable information to better inform clinical decision-making. This is particularly true in the era of targeted therapies (TT). A systematic review was undertaken on all studies with CML patients published from 1980 to 2010 and including a PRO evaluation. Out of 619 articles scrutinized, 15 met eligibility criteria and no study was published before 1995. Six dealt mainly with interferon-based therapies, 7 with bone marrow transplantation and only 2 evaluated PROs in the context of TT. No disease-specific, validated PRO instrument for these patients was found. The main evidence being that Imatinib provides clear advantage in terms of HRQOL over interferon-based treatments. There is lack of data concerning PROs in patients treated with current TT. Documenting HRQOL and side effects of CML treatments, from the patients' perspective is needed to evaluate overall treatment effectiveness and net clinical benefit of newer therapeutic strategies.},

In total, 448 CML patients were enrolled, and the SF-36 Health Survey was used to compare generic HRQOL profiles. Symptoms were also assessed. HRQOL comparisons were adjusted for key possible confounders. The median age of patients was 57 years and the median time of imatinib treatment was 5 years (range 3-9 years). The largest HRQOL differences were found in younger patients. In particular, patients aged between 18 and 39 years had marked impairments in role limitations because of physical and emotional problems, respectively: -22.6 (P < .001), -22.3 (P < .001). Patients with CML age 60 or older had a HRQOL profile very similar to that reported by the general population. Women had a worse profile than men when each were compared with their peers in the general population. Fatigue was the most frequently reported symptom. The HRQOL of CML patients is comparable with that of population norms in many areas, however, younger and female patients seem to report the major limitations.},

The primary objective of this study was to assess the quality of life (QOL) in patients with CP-CML treated with IM. Ninety patients with newly diagnosed CP-CML were assessed for QOL with first-line IM. Patients completed the cancer-specific FACT-BRM questionnaire (functional assessment of cancer therapy-biologic response modifiers) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. FACT-BRM consists of subscales including physical well-being (PWB), social and family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), BRM-physical, and BRM-mental. The primary endpoint was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI), created as a measure of physical function and well-being. An increase of ≥5 from baseline was considered to be a clinically significant improvement. The mean TOI score increased from 75.5 at baseline to 85.2 (p<0.0001) at 6 months, representing a healthy QOL. When comparing the individual TOI subscales, there was a mean increase of 16.4 in the daily functioning and well-being score, and a mean decrease of 6.2, 4.9, and 16.1 was noted in fatigue, emotional/cognitive dysfunction, and side-effects scores at 6 months, respectively. Improvement was not affected by age, sex, or Sokal score. With prolonged treatment, IM results in a higher physical well-being, less fatigue and emotional and cognitive dysfunction, and very few side-effects.},

  abstract        = {Quality of life (QOL) outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were evaluated in an international phase III study. Newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase CML were randomly assigned to imatinib or interferon alfa plus subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine (IFN+LDAC). Cross-over to the other treatment was permitted because of intolerance or lack of efficacy. Patients completed cancer-specific QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Biologic Response Modifiers) and utility (Euro QoL-5D) questionnaires at baseline and during treatment (n = 1,049). The primary QOL end point was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI; a measure of physical function and well-being). Secondary end points included social and family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB), and the utility score. Primary analyses were intention to treat with secondary analyses accounting for cross-over. Patients receiving IFN+LDAC experienced a large decline in the TOI, whereas those receiving imatinib maintained their baseline level. Treatment differences at each visit were significant (P <.001) and clinically relevant in favor of imatinib. Mean SFWB, EWB, and utility scores were also significantly better for those patients taking imatinib. Patients who crossed over to imatinib experienced a large increase in TOI; significant (P <.001) differences were observed between patients who did and did not cross over in favor of imatinib. Imatinib offers clear QOL advantages compared with IFN+LDAC as first-line treatment of chronic phase CML. In addition, patients who cross over to imatinib from IFN+LDAC experience a significant improvement in QOL compared with patients who continue to take IFN+LDAC.},

Eighty-nine patients (46 in first chronic phase, 43 in advanced phase) received an allogeneic BMT for CML during the study period. Medical outcomes and QOL of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-eight (31.5%) of 89 patients were alive at 10 years and included in this analysis. Thirteen (46.4%) of 28 long-term survivors never relapsed. Fifteen patients relapsed between 0.5 and 16 years after transplantation. Ten patients showed a hematologic relapse and received salvage treatment. Five patients showed transient low levels of BCR-ABL-positive cells by Southern blot with no subsequent hematologic relapse. One of the 28 patients died in blast crisis at 12 years. The most frequent long-term complications were chronic graft-versus-host disease, osteoporosis, and cataracts. Frequency of clonogenic progenitors remained persistently decreased. QOL assessment yielded lower scores in physical performance as compared with an age-matched normative population, whereas social functioning was equivalent. A high degree of satisfaction was noted with interpersonal relationships. Patients with CML surviving their BMT long term do well in terms of medical outcomes. A constant rate of relapse was noted, with a high salvage rate of affected patients, suggesting the need for lifelong monitoring. QOL is perceived as good, particularly as related to social functioning; however, it is inferior to a normative population with regard to physical performance.},

Psychosocial adjustment was most impaired in domains of life related to sexual relationships, vocational adjustment, social adjustment, and psychological distress. Females and older adults reported significantly higher dysfunction compared with males and younger subjects. Passage of time since bone marrow transplantation was unrelated to psychosocial improvement. Fatigue was the main symptom interfering with daily life in most (78.6%). Regression analysis showed that development of fatigue in our sample was mainly the result of the combined effects of anxiety, presence of pain, and infections (R2 = 0.75, p < .001), with weight loss showing a trend in relation to fatigue. Results indicate that unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation long-term survivors have an acceptable degree of quality of life, but rehabilitative services still need to be used for those who exhibit difficulties with their daily life.},

A sample of 28 survivors participated in the study. Quality of life was described in terms of "normality," enjoyment, and fulfillment with life: being psychologically and physically healthy, being independent, having family and relationships, having work, experiencing happiness, and having material support. There were many factors with which survivors found it difficult to cope: symptoms, frustration brought from the inabilities to function in life, family life, returning to work, and infertility. However, about 25% of the survivors reported a positive impact of the BMT on their lives. Main concerns about the future were related to health status, the long-term effects of the transplant, financial concern, infertility, the normalization process, and the family. These data confirmed that unrelated donor BMT patients do not have a different perception about their QOL than other BMT patients receiving autologous or allogeneic marrow transplants. Some of the issues that differed from the previous BMT literature included higher inability to perform daily tasks and dependency on others, adverse memories of the transplant, and concerns about the future. These areas should be the target of pretransplant interventions and the long-term psychosocial services provided to patients. As mentioned by the respondents, health care professionals could further improve their patients' QOL by providing counseling and psychologic support, education about the effects of the various treatments, and improved research in BMT treatment and side effects.},

  abstract        = {Individual participant data (IPD) from multiple sources allows external validation of a prognostic model across multiple populations. Often this reveals poor calibration, potentially causing poor predictive performance in some populations. However, rather than discarding the model outright, it may be possible to modify the model to improve performance using recalibration techniques. We use IPD meta-analysis to identify the simplest method to achieve good model performance. We examine four options for recalibrating an existing time-to-event model across multiple populations: (i) shifting the baseline hazard by a constant, (ii) re-estimating the shape of the baseline hazard, (iii) adjusting the prognostic index as a whole, and (iv) adjusting individual predictor effects. For each strategy, IPD meta-analysis examines (heterogeneity in) model performance across populations. Additionally, the probability of achieving good performance in a new population can be calculated allowing ranking of recalibration methods. In an applied example, IPD meta-analysis reveals that the existing model had poor calibration in some populations, and large heterogeneity across populations. However, re-estimation of the intercept substantially improved the expected calibration in new populations, and reduced between-population heterogeneity. Comparing recalibration strategies showed that re-estimating both the magnitude and shape of the baseline hazard gave the highest predicted probability of good performance in a new population. In conclusion, IPD meta-analysis allows a prognostic model to be externally validated in multiple settings, and enables recalibration strategies to be compared and ranked to decide on the least aggressive recalibration strategy to achieve acceptable external model performance without discarding existing model information.},

We identified 112,502 hospital admissions for AMI in England 2010-2017 from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) disease registry and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for 95,509 patients with a previous cancer diagnosis up to 15 years prior to admission. Cancer diagnoses were identified from the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD). We calculated the percentage of AMI admissions captured by each source and examined patient characteristics associated with source of ascertainment. Survival analysis assessed whether differences in survival between case-ascertainment sources could be explained by patient characteristics.57,265 (50.9%) AMI admissions in patients with a prior diagnosis of cancer were captured in both MINAP and HES. Patients captured in both sources were younger, more likely to have ST-segment elevation MI and had better prognosis, with lower mortality rates up to 9 years after AMI admission compared with patients captured in only one source. The percentage of admissions captured in both data sources improved over time. Cancer characteristics (site, stage and grade) had little effect on how AMI was captured. MINAP and HES define different populations of patients with AMI. However, cancer characteristics do not substantially impact on case-ascertainment. These findings support a strategy of using multiple linked data sources for observational cardio-oncological research into AMI.},

We followed 4,529,460 Swedes from 1987 to 2010 and identified ALS and fractures from the Swedish National Patient Register. We examined associations of ALS risk with all fractures, osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic fractures, and traumatic and non-traumatic fractures among individuals aged 30-80 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed the association of ALS with time since fracture using a Poisson regression model. All fractures (HR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.39-1.65) as well as osteoporotic (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.41-1.79), non-osteoporotic (HR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.31-1.63), traumatic (HR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.37-1.63), and non-traumatic (HR: 1.80, 95% CI 1.35-2.40) fractures were associated with a higher incidence of ALS. Increased ALS incidence was associated with fractures occurring from one (HR: 2.33, 95% CI 2.04-2.66) to 18 (HR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.43) years before ALS diagnosis. Poor bone health may be related to ALS. These findings may offer insight into ALS pathophysiology.},

  abstract        = {Most of the few published models used to obtain small-area estimates of relative survival are based on a generalized linear model with piecewise constant hazards under a Bayesian formulation. Limitations of these models include the need to artificially split the time scale, restricted ability to include continuous covariates, and limited predictive capacity. Here, an alternative Bayesian approach is proposed: a spatial flexible parametric relative survival model. This overcomes previous limitations by combining the benefits of flexible parametric models: the smooth, well-fitting baseline hazard functions and predictive ability, with the Bayesian benefits of robust and reliable small-area estimates. Both spatially structured and unstructured frailty components are included. Spatial smoothing is conducted using the intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior. The model was applied to breast, colorectal, and lung cancer data from the Queensland Cancer Registry across 478 geographical areas. Advantages of this approach include the ease of including more realistic complexity, the feasibility of using individual-level input data, and the capacity to conduct overall, cause-specific, and relative survival analysis within the same framework. Spatial flexible parametric survival models have great potential for exploring small-area survival inequalities, and we hope to stimulate further use of these models within wider contexts.

Organizational factors such as bed occupancy have been associated with an increased incidence of CDI; however, the data are sparse, and the association has not been widely demonstrated. We investigated the association of bed occupancy and CDI within a large hospital organization in the United Kingdom. To establish whether bed occupancy rates are a significant risk factor for CDI in the general ward setting. A retrospective cohort study was carried out on data from 2006 to 2008. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression modeling was used to examine the strength and significance of the associations. Variables included patient characteristics, antibiotic policy exposure, case mix, and bed occupancy rates. A total of 1,589 cases of hospital-acquired CDI were diagnosed (1.7% of admissions), with an overall infection rate of 2.16 per 1,000 patient-days. Median bed occupancy was 93.3% (interquartile range, 83.3%-100%) Univariate and multivariate analyses showed positive and statistically significant associations. In the adjusted model, patients on wards with occupancy rates of 80%-89.9% had rates of CDI that were 56% higher (hazard ratio, 1.56 [95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.04]; P < .001) compared with baseline (0%-69.9% occupancy). CDI rates were 55% higher for patients on wards with maximal bed occupancy (100%). There is strong evidence of an association between high bed occupancy and CDI. Without effective interventions at high levels of bed occupancy, the economic benefits sought from reducing bed numbers may be negated by the increased risk of CDI.},

The aim of this study was to outline sex differences in prognostic factors and clinical management and to explore whether these can explain the poorer urinary bladder cancer outcome in women. We performed a population-based cohort study including all patients diagnosed with urothelial bladder cancer between 1997 and 2014 at age 18 to 89 who had data recorded in the Swedish Urinary Bladder Cancer Register (n = 36,344). Female-to-male odds ratios for clinical management parameters were estimated by logistic regression. To quantify sex differences in bladder cancer-specific survival, we estimated empirical survival proportions and mortality rates as well as applied flexible parametric models to estimate female-to-male hazard ratios and survival proportions over follow-up. Adjusted models included age, year, World Health Organization grade, stage, marital status, education, health care region, birth country, and comorbidity. Except for an adverse stage distribution in women, we found no evidence of unequal clinical management. Among those diagnosed with bladder cancer, women had a higher bladder cancer mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.23) driven by muscle-invasive tumors (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-1.34). The female survival disadvantage was confined to the first 2 years after diagnosis. The excess bladder cancer mortality in women is limited to those diagnosed with muscle-invasive tumors and cannot be explained by the examined clinicopathologic factors. Further investigations of sex differences in therapeutic procedures and outcomes, including complications, of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, must be performed.},

Flexible parametric models were applied to compute adjusted female-to-male hazard ratios (aHRs) and standardized survival proportions over follow-up including age, calendar year, education, marital status, birth country, health care region, performance status, smoking history, comorbidities, and tumor location in the final model. Women presented with better performance status, were younger, and more often never-smokers. Women with adenocarcinoma also had lower comorbidity burden, less advanced stage, and were more often EGFR positive. Men with adenocarcinoma had a consistently poorer lung cancer-specific survival across stage; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.63-0.76 (stage IA-IIB) to 0.94; 95% CI 0.88-0.99 (stage IIIB-IV), remaining largely unchanged after adjustments; aHR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66-0.82 to 0.84; 95% CI 0.81-0.87. The same pattern was observed in squamous cell carcinoma, except in stage IIIA disease, where we found no sex differences in survival. Men with non-small cell lung cancer have a consistently poorer prognosis, even after careful adjustments for a wide range of prognostic factors. While the pattern was similar in both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, it was larger and more consistent in the latter.},

The effect of reproductive factors on prognosis in women remains unknown and population-based studies are needed. A nationwide cohort of 21,237 Swedish women with a recorded haematological malignancy at ages 18-69 years was identified in the Swedish Cancer Register 1970-2018. Pre-diagnosis childbirths for each woman were linked to the Swedish Multigeneration Register. Net survival and excess hazard ratios for parity, age at first birth, time since the latest birth, and sex of offspring were estimated using flexible parametric models adjusted for age, year, and educational level. In unadjusted analyses, parity (  = 0.0012) and high age at first birth (  < 0.0001) were associated with better survival. After co-adjustments for reproductive factors and confounders, the associations were attenuated. The adjusted association with parity was mainly observed among women aged above 40 years at diagnosis (  = 0.0033). The associations with reproductive factors were non-significant across subtypes of haematological malignancy. There was a tendency of higher excess mortality for an increasing number of boys compared to girls, although only significant for women with three or more children (  = 0.0126). Reproductive factors were in part associated with survival following diagnosis of a haematological malignancy. However, the effect sizes were small with inconsistent association patterns, and thus reproductive factors may only partly contribute to the survival advantage of women over men.},

  abstract        = {In Part I of our review of cancer outcome research, we analysed pros and cons of various measures relevant to quantifying the burden of cancer. Based on our recommendations in Part I, we now discuss in Part II opportunities and priorities in four areas of outcome research: primary prevention; early detection screening; treatment; and quality-of-life assessment. We recommend the establishment of an infrastructure that facilitates high-quality research in these areas: (a) progress in primary prevention can be assessed most directly by monitoring cancer incidence although the interpretation of temporal trends is notoriously confounded by numerous factors that complicate causal inference. (b) preventive screening, with the aim to prevent advanced disease, appears to work well in in some tumours but not in others. It will require randomized control trials (RCTs) to quantify benefits and harms although conclusive studies are increasingly difficult to undertake. We therefore propose learning screening programmes (randomization at the time of rolling out population-based programmes) as the most feasible approach. (c) New therapeutic interventions tailored to the individual patient often require assessment in RCTs with rather complex and dynamic structure, making their design and analyses increasingly challenging but also more suited to be executed as academic, PI-initiated trials. (d) We next discuss assessment of quality-of-life aspects. Quality of life is a neglected component in outcome research with an urgent need for development, validation and standardization. We finally recommend four initiatives that would pave the way for a valid and informative assessment of the goals for improved cancer control in Europe as defined by the European Academy of Cancer Sciences.},

The cohort consisted of 13,009 Swedish CLL patients diagnosed 1982-2013. Relative survival (RS) and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using flexible parametric survival models. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for the linear effect of 10-year increase in year of diagnosis. The excess mortality decreased comparing 2003-2013 to 1982-1992 (EMRR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.58). The 5-year RS increased between 1982 and 2012 for patients >51 years at diagnosis and improved for patients ≤51 years after 2002. The rate of CLL-specific deaths decreased over time (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.75-0.81). Compared to patients with no comorbidity, patients with 1 and 2+ Charlson Comorbidity Index points had HR = 1.35 (95% CI 1.25-1.45) and HR = 1.47 (95% CI 1.37-1.57) for CLL-related mortality, respectively. Survival in CLL patients improved in the era of chemoimmunotherapy, and this was largely explained by reduced CLL-related mortality. The increased rate of CLL-related mortality in patients with comorbidities emphasizes the importance of the newer and better tolerated targeted therapy.},

To lay the ground for assessment of progress and to promote cancer outcomes research in general, we have reviewed the most common population-based measures of the cancer burden. We emphasize the complexities and complementary approaches to measure cancer survival and the novel opportunities for improved assessment of quality of life. We propose that: incidence and mortality rates are standardized to the European population; net survival is used as the measure of prognosis but with proper adjustments for confounding when temporal trends in overall cancer survival are assessed; and cancer-specific quality of life is measured by a combination of existing questionnaires and utilizes emerging communication technologies. We conclude that all measures are important and that a meaningful interpretation also requires a deep understanding of the larger clinical and public health context.},

We compared RS and CSS in men with prostate cancer (PCa) according to age and risk category, using Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden, including 168,793 men younger than age 90 years, diagnosed 1998-2016 with PCa. RS and CSS were compared according to age and risk category based on TNM (tumor, nodes, and metastases) stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level. Each framework requires assumptions that are unlikely to be appropriate for PCa. Ten-year RS was substantially higher than CSS in men aged 80-89 with low-risk PCa: 125% (95% confidence interval: 113, 138) versus 85% (95% confidence interval: 82, 88). In contrast, RS and CSS were similar for men under age 70 and for all men with regional or distant metastases. Both RS and CSS produce biased estimates of net survival for men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, in particular for men over 80. Due to biases, net survival is overestimated in analysis of RS but underestimated in analysis of CSS. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the underlying assumptions for each method, because the "true" net survival is expected to lie between the limits of RS and CSS.},

  abstract        = {Recently, plateletpheresis donations using a widely used leukoreduction system (LRS) chamber have been associated with T-cell lymphopenia. However, clinical health consequences of plateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia are still unknown. A nationwide cohort study using the SCANDAT3-S database was conducted with all platelet- and plasmapheresis donors in Sweden between 1996 and 2017. A Cox proportional hazards model, using donations as time-dependent exposures, was used to assess the risk of infections associated with plateletpheresis donations using an LRS chamber. A total of 74 408 apheresis donors were included. Among donors with the same donation frequency, plateletpheresis donors using an LRS chamber were at an increased risk of immunosuppression-related infections and common bacterial infections in a dose-dependent manner. While very frequent donors and infections were rare in absolute terms resulting in wide confidence intervals (CIs), the increased risk was significant starting at one-third or less of the allowed donation frequency in a 10-year exposure window, with hazard ratios reaching 10 or more. No plateletpheresis donors that used an LRS chamber experienced a Pneumocystis jirovecii, aspergillus, disseminated mycobacterial, or cryptococcal infection. In a subcohort (n = 42), donations with LRS were associated with low CD4+ T-cell counts (Pearson's R = -0.41; 95% CI, - 0.63 to -0.12). Frequent plateletpheresis donation using an LRS chamber was associated with CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia and an increased risk of infections. These findings suggest a need to monitor T-lymphocyte counts in frequent platelet donors and to conduct future investigations of long-term donor health and for regulators to consider steps to mitigate lymphodepletion in donors.},

All surgically treated patients with CRC registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry with stage I-III between 1990-2016, were included (N = 203,216). Estimates of conditional LEL were predicted using flexible parametric models and the total life years lost due to cancer were estimated. LEL decreased with older age and patients with rectal cancer or higher disease stage had highest LEL. In 2010, LEL for sixty-year old male and female patients was 2 vs. 2, 4 vs. 4, and 7 vs. 8 years for colon cancer, and 2 vs. 2, 4 vs. 5 and 7 vs. 8 years for rectal cancer, respectively. Conditional LEL in patients with CRC decreased during follow-up. Patients with combined stage I-III colon and rectal cancer in 2010 lost an estimated 18,628 and 11,336 life years. This study quantified the impact of CRC on patient's life expectancy, both on individual and population level and demonstrated temporal improvements in CRC survival. These results provide meaningful information that can be used during follow-up.},

All patients with pathologic stage I-III CRC treated with endoscopy or surgery, diagnosed and registered in the Netherlands Cancer Registry between 1995 and 2016, and aged 18 to 99 years were included. Conditional survival was calculated for those diagnosed before and after 2007. Cure proportions were calculated using flexible parametric models. A total of 175,384 patients with pathologic stage I (25%), II (38%), or III disease (37%) were included. Conditional 5-year survival of patients with stage I, II, and III colon cancer having survived 5 years was 98%, 94%, and 92%, respectively. For patients with stage I-III rectal cancer, this was 96%, 89%, and 85%, respectively. Statistical cure in patients with colon cancer was reached directly after diagnosis (stage I) to 6 years (stage III) after diagnosis depending on age, sex, and disease stage. Patients with rectal cancer reached cure 0.5 years after diagnosis (stage I) to 9 years after diagnosis (stage III). In 1995, approximately 42% to 46% of patients with stage III colon or rectal cancer, respectively, were considered cured, whereas in 2016 this percentage increased to 73% to 78%, respectively. The number of patients with CRC reaching cure has increased substantially over the years. This study's results provide valuable insights into trends of CRC patient survival and are important for patients, clinicians, and policymakers.},

A nationwide population-based study was conducted using data from the Swedish Cancer Registry on 46,350 women aged 18 or older with a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal, or undesignated abdominal/pelvic cancer 1960 to 2014. Analyses of age-standardized incidence and relative survival (RS) were performed and time trends modelled according to age, tumor site, and morphology. Overall incidence of ovarian, tubal, peritoneal, and undesignated abdominal/pelvic cancers declined since 1980. Median age at diagnosis increased. Serous carcinoma increased in incidence. RS at 1, 2 and 5 years from diagnosis improved since 1960, although not for the youngest and the oldest patients. Ten-year RS did not improve. The best RS was found for fallopian tube cancer and the worst RS for undesignated abdominal/pelvic cancer. Among the morphologic subgroups, endometrioid carcinoma had the best RS. Survival in epithelial ovarian, tubal, peritoneal, and undesignated abdominal/pelvic cancers in Sweden has improved over the last six decades. Advances in epithelial ovarian cancer treatment have extended life for the first 5 years from diagnosis but 10-year survival remains poor.},

  abstract        = {Monitoring survival of cancer patients using data collected by population-based cancer registries is an important component of cancer control. In this setting, patient survival is often summarized using net survival, that is survival from cancer if there were no other possible causes of death. Although net survival is the gold standard for comparing survival between groups or over time, it is less relevant for understanding the anticipated real-world prognosis of patients. In this review, we explain statistical concepts targeted towards patients, clinicians and healthcare professionals that summarize cancer patient survival under the assumption that other causes of death exist. Specifically, we explain the appropriate use, interpretation and assumptions behind statistical methods for competing risks, loss in life expectancy due to cancer and conditional survival. These concepts are relevant when producing statistics for risk communication between physicians and patients, planning for use of healthcare resources, or other applications when consideration of both cancer outcomes and the competing risks of death is required. To reinforce the concepts, we use Swedish population-based data of patients diagnosed with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon and chronic myeloid leukaemia. We conclude that when choosing between summary measures of survival it is critical to characterize the purpose of the study and to determine the nature of the hypothesis under investigation. The choice of terminology and style of reporting should be carefully adapted to the target audience and may range from summaries for specialist readers of scientific publications to interactive online tools aimed towards lay persons.},

Its association with established risk factors for breast cancer is not fully investigated. To study the association between BPE and risk factors for breast cancer in a healthy, non-high-risk screening population. We measured BPE and mammographic density and used data from self-reported questionnaires in 214 healthy women aged 43-74 years. We estimated odds ratios for the univariable association between BPE and risk factors. We then fitted an adjusted model using logistic regression to evaluate associations between BPE (high vs. low) and risk factors, including mammographic breast density. The majority of women had low BPE (84%). In a multivariable model, we found statistically significant associations between BPE and age (  = 0.002) and BMI (  = 0.03). We did find a significant association between systemic progesterone medication and BPE, but due to small numbers, the results should be interpreted with caution. The adjusted odds ratio for high BPE was 3.1 among women with density D (compared to B) and 2.1 for density C (compared to B). However, the association between high BPE and density was not statistically significant. We did not find statistically significant associations with any other risk factors. Our study confirmed the known association of BPE with age and BMI. Although our results show a higher likelihood for high BPE with increasing levels of mammographic density, the association was not statistically significant.},

  abstract        = {We aimed to estimate the incremental cancer detection rate achieved by adding three-dimensional functional infrared imaging (3DIRI) to digital mammography in women with dense breasts. In this prospective study conducted between December 2014 and April 2016, 1727 women (median age 56) with percentage volumetric breast density > 6% were recruited at routine screening mammography to undergo additional 3DIRI. The 3DIRI findings were classified as negative or positive. Women with a negative mammography but positive 3DIRI were referred to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, whereas all other women underwent routine follow-up based on the mammography finding. Diagnosis of breast cancer was verified by histopathologic examination. The number of women diagnosed with a malignancy formed the basis of our statistical analysis. Mammography detected 7 cancers in 7 women. Of 1692 women with negative mammography, 222 women (13%) had a positive 3DIRI of which 219 underwent MRI. An additional 6 cancers were identified in 5 women, increasing the diagnostic yield from 7 of 1727 (0.41%) to 12 of 1727 (0.69%). The incremental cancer detection rate associated with using 3DIRI to select women for MRI was 5 of 222 (22.5 additional cancers per 1000). The use of 3DIRI to select women for an additional MRI can result in the detection of additional cancers in women with dense breasts, but at the expense of additional false positives and considerably lower positive predictive value of the combined examinations. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the role of 3DIRI as an adjunct to mammography. • Use of three-dimensional functional infrared imaging to select women for an MRI in addition to screening mammography has the potential to improve breast cancer detection in women with dense breasts.},

  abstract        = {The reported incidence of Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) differs substantially between previous reports, likely due to true regional differences in incidence and/or variations in the quality and coverage of the cancer registers. We therefore assessed MPN incidence in Sweden during recent years using prospectively collected information captured in Swedish health registers. Patients with MPNs were identified through the Swedish Cancer Register and Swedish Blood Cancer Register between 2000 and 2014. Information on the Swedish population was obtained from the Human Mortality Database. Crude and age-standardized incidence rates of MPNs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 6281 MPN cases were reported to the Swedish Cancer Register and Swedish Blood Cancer Register during 2000-2014. The age-standardized, to the Swedish population in 2000, incidence for all MPNs was 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.34-4.56)/100 000 person-years. The age-standardized incidence for polycythemia vera was 1.48 (1.42-1.54), for essential thrombocythemia 1.60 (1.53-1.66) and for primary myelofibrosis 0.52 (0.48-0.56)/100 000 person-years, respectively. The incidence rate of MPNs was substantially higher in the older compared to the younger age groups. The incidence increased during the study period, likely to do better reporting and increasing age of the general population. The reported MPN incidences in our study, which were in the higher interval of previously published studies, are likely more accurate compared to previous reports due to the population-based setting and high level of coverage in the Swedish Cancer and Blood Cancer Registers.},

From national Swedish registers, 9379 patients with MPNs diagnosed between 1973 and 2009, and 35,682 matched controls were identified as well as information on second malignancies, with follow-up until 2010. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox regression and a flexible parametric model. There was a significantly increased risk of any non-hematologic cancer with HR of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5-1.7). The HRs for non-melanoma skin cancer was 2.8 (2.4-3.3), kidney cancer 2.8 (2.0-4.0), brain cancer 2.8 (1.9-4.2), endocrine cancers 2.5 (1.6-3.8), malignant melanoma 1.9 (1.4-2.7), pancreas cancer 1.8 (1.2-2.6), lung cancer 1.7 (1.4-2.2), and head and neck cancer 1.7 (1.2-2.6). The HR of second malignancies was similar across all MPN subtypes, sex, and calendar periods of MPN diagnosis. The risk of developing a hematologic malignancy was also significantly increased; the HR for acute myeloid leukemia was 46.0 (32.6-64.9) and for lymphoma 2.6 (2.0-3.3). In conclusion, our study provides robust population-based support of an increased cancer risk in MPN patients.},

We re-examine the collectivity of drinking theory by applying quantile regression methods to the analysis and interpretation of Swedish youth alcohol consumption. Changes in youth alcohol consumption between 2000 and 2014 were assessed using a school-based survey conducted in Stockholm (n = 86,402). Participants were Swedish youth aged 15-18 years. The rate of change in consumption was examined using quantile regression, and compared to Ordinary Least Squares modelling. The hypothesis of parallelism or 'in concert' changes in consumption was assessed using the test of the equality of linear regression slopes corresponding to different quantiles of log consumption. In both models, changes in consumption over time did not occur in parallel, contrary to the collectivity of drinking theory. Instead, a clear divergence in the rate of drinking was observed, with most adolescent quantiles reducing consumption, while heavy consuming remained stable. Contrary to previous studies, our findings do not support a collectivity of drinking behaviour among Swedish youth. Quantile regression is a robust and appropriate method for analysing temporal changes in alcohol consumption data.},

  abstract        = {The Cancer Register (CR) in Sweden has reported that the incidence of primary liver cancer (PLC) has slowly declined over the last decades. Even though all cancers, irrespective of diagnostic method, should be reported to the CR, the PLC incidence may not reflect the true rate. Improved diagnostic tools have enabled diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma based on noninvasive methods without histological verification, possibly associated with missed cancer reports or misclassification in the CR. Our objective was to study the completeness and assess the underreporting of PLC to the CR and to produce a more accurate estimate based on three registers. The CR, the Cause of Death Register, and the Patient Register were investigated. Differences and overlap were examined, the incidence was estimated by merging data from the registers, and the number reported to none of the registers was estimated using a log-linear capture-recapture model. The results show that 98% of the PLCs reported to the CR were histologically verified; 80% were hepatocellular carcinoma and 20% were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Unspecified liver cancer decreased over time and constituted <10% of all reported liver cancers. The CR may underestimate the liver cancer incidence by 37%-45%, primarily due to missed cancer reports. The estimated annual number of liver cancers increased over time, but the standardized incidence was stable around 11 per 100,000. Hepatitis C-associated liver cancer increased and constituted 20% in 2010. There was an underreporting of PLC diagnosed by noninvasive methods; the incidence was considerably higher than estimated by the CR, with a stable incidence over time; reporting needs to improve and combining registers is recommended when studying incidence.

  abstract        = {Clinical management of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) has changed considerably over recent years, reflected in the use of new therapeutic agents (purine analogs, monoclonal antibodies, thalidomide- and bortezomib-based therapies). No population-based studies and few randomized trials have been performed to assess survival in newly diagnosed LPL/WM. We performed a large population-based study in Sweden including 1,555 LPL/WM patients diagnosed from 1980 to 2005. Relative survival ratios (RSRs) and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) were computed as measures of survival. Survival of LPL/WM patients has improved significantly (P = 0.007) over time with 5-year RSR = 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.68), 0.65 (0.57-0.73), 0.74 (0.68-0.80), 0.72 (0.66-0.77), and 0.78 (0.71-0.85) for patients diagnosed during the calendar periods 1980-1985, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2005, respectively. Improvement in 1- and 5-year relative survival was found in all age groups and for LPL and WM separately. Patients with WM had lower excess mortality compared to LPL (EMRR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.30-0.48). Older age at diagnosis was associated with a poorer survival (P < 0.001). Taken together, we found a significant improvement in survival in LPL/WM over time. Despite this progress, new effective agents with a more favourable toxicity profile are needed to further improve survival in LPL/WM, especially in the elderly.},

Survival analysis outputs are influential inputs into economic models estimating the cost-effectiveness of new cancer treatments. Hence, it is important that systematic and justifiable model selection approaches are used. This study investigates the extent to which the TSD recommendations have been followed since its publication.   We reviewed NICE cancer TAs completed between July 2011 and July 2017. Information on survival analyses undertaken and associated critiques for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were extracted from the company submissions, Evidence Review Group (ERG) reports, and final appraisal determination documents.   Information was extracted from 58 TAs. Only 4 (7%) followed all TSD recommendations for OS outcomes. The vast majority (91%) compared a range of common parametric models and assessed their fit to the data (86%). Only a minority of TAs included an assessment of the shape of the hazard function (38%) or proportional hazards assumption (40%). Validation of the extrapolated portion of the survival function using external data was attempted in a minority of TAs (40%). Extrapolated survival functions were frequently criticized by ERGs (71%).   Survival analysis within NICE TAs remains suboptimal, despite publication of the TSD. Model selection is not undertaken in a systematic way, resulting in inconsistencies between TAs. More attention needs to be given to assessing hazard functions and validation of extrapolated survival functions. Novel methods not described in the TSD have been used, particularly in the context of immuno-oncology, suggesting that an updated TSD may be of value.},

  abstract        = {A commonly reported measure when interested in the survival of cancer patients is relative survival. Relative survival circumvents issues with inaccurate cause of death information by incorporating the expected mortality rates of cancer individuals from population lifetables of the general population. A summary of the cancer population prognosis can be obtained using the marginal relative survival. To explore differences between exposure groups, such as socioeconomic groups, the difference in marginal relative survival between exposed and unexposed can be obtained and under assumptions is interpreted as the average causal effect of exposure to survival. In a modeling context, this is usually estimated by applying regression standardization as the average of the individual-specific estimates after fitting a relative survival model. Regression standardization yields an estimator that consistently estimates the causal effect under standard causal inference assumptions and if the relative survival model is correctly specified. We extend inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust standardization methods in the relative survival framework as additional valuable tools for obtaining average causal effects when correct model specification might not hold for the relative survival model. IPW yields an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect if a correctly specified model has been fitted for the exposure (propensity score) whereas doubly robust standardization requires that at least one of the propensity score model or the relative survival model is correctly specified. An example using data on melanoma is provided and a simulation study is conducted to investigate how sensitive are the methods to model misspecification, including different ways for obtaining standard errors.},

We aimed to evaluate associations of serum selenium, a marker of dietary selenium, with measures of glucose metabolism and risk of diabetes. We used data from a population-based, longitudinal cohort of 1925 Swedish men who were 50 years old and did not have diabetes at baseline in the 1970s. At baseline, an intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed and, at a follow-up examination after 20 years, an oral glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp for the assessment of insulin sensitivity were conducted. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation) selenium concentration was 75.6 (14.3) μg/l. During 20 years of follow-up, 88 incident cases of diabetes occurred in 1024 participants with follow-up data. Baseline serum selenium levels were not associated with risk of diabetes (odds ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.83-1.38). Higher selenium levels were associated with lower early insulin response (standardized β -0.08; 95% CI -0.14 to -0.03) at baseline after adjusting for potential confounders, but not with any other measures of β-cell function or insulin sensitivity at baseline or follow-up. The association with early insulin response was non-significant after taking multiple testing into account. Our results do not support a role of dietary selenium in the development of disturbances in glucose metabolism or diabetes in older individuals.},

  abstract        = {Ensuring fair comparisons of cancer survival statistics across population groups requires careful consideration of differential competing mortality due to other causes, and adjusting for imbalances over groups in other prognostic covariates (e.g. age). This has typically been achieved using comparisons of age-standardised net survival, with age standardisation addressing covariate imbalance, and the net estimates removing differences in competing mortality from other causes. However, these estimates lack ease of interpretability. In this paper, we motivate an alternative non-parametric approach that uses a common rate of other cause mortality across groups to give reference-adjusted estimates of the all-cause and cause-specific crude probability of death in contrast to solely reporting net survival estimates. We develop the methodology for a non-parametric equivalent of standardised and reference adjusted crude probabilities of death, building on the estimation of non-parametric crude probabilities of death. We illustrate the approach using regional comparisons of survival following a diagnosis of rectal cancer for men in England. We standardise to the covariate distribution and other cause mortality of England as a whole to offer comparability, but with close approximation to the observed all-cause region-specific mortality. The approach gives comparable estimates to observed crude probabilities of death, but allows direct comparison across population groups with different covariate profiles and competing mortality patterns. In our illustrative example, we show that regional variations in survival following a diagnosis of rectal cancer persist even after accounting for the variation in deprivation, age at diagnosis and other cause mortality. The methodological approach of using standardised and reference adjusted metrics offers an appealing approach for future cancer survival comparison studies and routinely published cancer statistics. Our non-parametric estimation approach through the use of weighting offers the ability to estimate comparable survival estimates without the need for statistical modelling.},

When deaths are ascertained by linkage with vital statistics registers, some may be missed, and such individuals will wrongly appear to be long-term survivors, and survival will be overestimated. Interval-specific relative survival that levels off above one indicates that the survival among the cancer patients is better than expected, which could be due to the presence of immortals. We included colon cancer cases diagnosed in 1995-1999 within the 19 jurisdictions in seven countries participating in ICBP SURVMARK-2, with follow-up information available until end-2015. Interval-specific relative survival was estimated for each year following diagnosis, by country and age group at diagnosis. The interval-specific relative survival levels off at 1 for all countries and age groups, with two exceptions: for the age group diagnosed at age 75 years and above in Ireland, and, to a lesser extent, in New Zealand. Overall, a subset of immortals are not apparent in the early years within the ICBP SURVMARK-2 study, except for possibly in Ireland. We suggest this approach as one strategy of exploring the existence of immortals, and to be part of routine checks of cancer registry data.},

The minimum sample size criteria aim to ensure precise estimation of key measures of a model's predictive performance, including measures of calibration, discrimination, and net benefit. Here, we extend the sample size guidance to prediction models with a time-to-event (survival) outcome, to cover external validation in datasets containing censoring. A simulation-based framework is proposed, which calculates the sample size required to target a particular confidence interval width for the calibration slope measuring the agreement between predicted risks (from the model) and observed risks (derived using pseudo-observations to account for censoring) on the log cumulative hazard scale. Precise estimation of calibration curves, discrimination, and net-benefit can also be checked in this framework. The process requires assumptions about the validation population in terms of the (i) distribution of the model's linear predictor and (ii) event and censoring distributions. Existing information can inform this; in particular, the linear predictor distribution can be approximated using the C-index or Royston's D statistic from the model development article, together with the overall event risk. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to calculate the sample size required to validate a prediction model for recurrent venous thromboembolism. Ideally the sample size should ensure precise calibration across the entire range of predicted risks, but must at least ensure adequate precision in regions important for clinical decision-making.

In a multi-state setting, there are various measures to be estimated that are of great epidemiological importance. However, increased complexity of the multi-state setting and predictions over time for individuals with different covariate patterns may lead to increased difficulty in communicating the estimated measures. The need for easy and meaningful communication of the analysis results motivated the development of a web tool to address these issues. MSMplus is a publicly available web tool, developed via the Shiny R package, with the aim of enhancing the understanding of multi-state model analyses results. The results from any multi-state model analysis are uploaded to the application in a pre-specified format. Through a variety of user-tailored interactive graphs, the application contributes to an improvement in communication, reporting and interpretation of multi-state analysis results as well as comparison between different approaches. The predicted measures that can be supported by MSMplus include, among others, the transition probabilities, the transition intensity rates, the length of stay in each state, the probability of ever visiting a state and user defined measures. Representation of differences, ratios and confidence intervals of the aforementioned measures are also supported. MSMplus is a useful tool that enhances communication and understanding of multi-state model analyses results. Further use and development of web tools should be encouraged in the future as a means to communicate scientific research.},

  abstract        = {We modeled the clinical course of a cohort of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients with no prior cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using a multistate modeling framework. Data on 2600 patients with DLBCL diagnosed between 2000 and 2018 and had received chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy were obtained from a population-wide electronic health database of Hong Kong. We used the Markov illness-death model to quantify the impact of doxorubicin and various risk factors (therapeutic exposure, demographic, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, and lifestyle factors which included smoking) on the clinical course of DLBCL (transitions into incident CVD, lymphoma death, and other causes of death). A total of 613 (23.6%) and 230 (8.8%) of 2600 subjects died of lymphoma and developed incident CVD, respectively. Median follow-up was 7.0 years (interquartile range 3.8-10.8 years). Older ages [hazard ratio (HR) for >75 versus ≤60 years 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-2.82 and HR for 61-75 versus ≤60 years 1.60; 95% CI 1.12-2.30], hypertension (HR 4.92; 95% CI 2.61-9.26), diabetes (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.87), and baseline use of aspirin (HR 5.30; 95% CI 3.93-7.16) were associated with an increased risk of incident CVD. In a subgroup of anticipated higher-risk patients (aged 61-75 years, smoked, had diabetes, and received doxorubicin), we found that they remained on average 7.9 (95% CI 7.2-8.8) years in the DLBCL state and 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-0.4) years in the CVD state, if they could be followed up for 10 years. The brief time in the CVD state is consistent with the high chance of death in patients who developed CVD. Other causes of death have overtaken DLBCL-related death after about 5 years. In this Asian population-based cohort, we found that incident CVDs can occur soon after DLBCL treatment and continued to occur throughout survivorship. Clinicians are advised to balance the risks and benefits of treatment choices to minimize the risk of CVD.},

  abstract        = {Comparisons of population-based cancer survival between countries are important to benchmark the overall effectiveness of cancer management. The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP) Survmark-2 study aims to compare survival in seven high-income countries across eight cancer sites and explore reasons for the observed differences. A critical aspect in ensuring comparability in the reported survival estimates are similarities in practice across cancer registries. While ICBP Survmark-2 has shown these differences are unlikely to explain the observed differences in cancer-specific survival between countries, it is important to keep in mind potential biases linked to registry practice and understand their likely impact. Based on experiences gained within ICBP Survmark-2, we have developed a set of recommendations that seek to optimally harmonise cancer registry datasets to improve future benchmarking exercises. Our recommendations stem from considering the impact on cancer survival estimates in five key areas: (1) the completeness of the registry and the availability of registration sources; (2) the inclusion of death certification as a source of identifying cases; (3) the specification of the date of incidence; (4) the approach to handling multiple primary tumours and (5) the quality of linkage of cases to the deaths register. These recommendations seek to improve comparability whilst maintaining the opportunity to understand and act upon international variations in outcomes among cancer patients.},

We used SEER data for patients diagnosed in 2000 to 2013, followed-up through December 31, 2014. For RS, we used new life tables accounting for geography and socio-economic status. For CSS, we used the SEER cause of death algorithm for attributing cancer-specific death. Estimates were compared by site, age, stage, race, and time since diagnosis. Differences between 5-year RS and CSS were generally small. RS was always higher in screen-detectable cancers, for example, female breast (89.2% vs. 87.8%) and prostate (98.5% vs. 93.7%) cancers; differences increased with age or time since diagnosis. CSS was usually higher in the remaining cancer sites, particularly those related to specific risk factors, for example, cervix (70.9% vs. 68.3%) and liver (20.7% vs. 17.1%) cancers. For most cancer sites, the gap between estimates was smaller with more advanced stage.  RS is the preferred approach to report cancer survival from registry data because cause of death may be inaccurate, particularly for older patients and long-term survivors as comorbidities increase challenges in determining cause of death. However, CSS proved to be more reliable in patients diagnosed with localized disease or cancers related to specific risk factors as general population life tables may not capture other causes of mortality. Different approaches for net survival estimation should be considered depending on cancer under study.},

  abstract        = {When interested in a time-to-event outcome, competing events that prevent the occurrence of the event of interest may be present. In the presence of competing events, various estimands have been suggested for defining the causal effect of treatment on the event of interest. Depending on the estimand, the competing events are either accommodated or eliminated, resulting in causal effects with different interpretations. The former approach captures the total effect of treatment on the event of interest while the latter approach captures the direct effect of treatment on the event of interest that is not mediated by the competing event. Separable effects have also been defined for settings where the treatment can be partitioned into two components that affect the event of interest and the competing event through different causal pathways. We outline various causal effects that may be of interest in the presence of competing events, including total, direct and separable effects, and describe how to obtain estimates using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. Regression standardisation is applied by obtaining the average of individual estimates across all individuals in a study population after fitting a survival model. With standsurv several contrasts of interest can be calculated including differences, ratios and other user-defined functions. Confidence intervals can also be obtained using the delta method. Throughout we use an example analysing a publicly available dataset on prostate cancer to allow the reader to replicate the analysis and further explore the different effects of interest. Several causal effects can be defined in the presence of competing events and, under assumptions, estimates of those can be obtained using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. The choice of which causal effect to define should be given careful consideration based on the research question and the audience to which the findings will be communicated.},

Ten-year cause-specific and relative survival were estimated for lung, breast, prostate, ovary, oesophagus and colorectal cancers. The cause-specific survival was corrected for misclassification of cause of death. The Pohar-Perme relative survival estimator was modified by (1) correcting for differences in deaths from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) between cancers and general population; or (2) correcting the population hazard for smoking (lung cancer only). For all cancers except breast and prostate, relative survival was lower than cause-specific. Correction for published error rates in cause of death gave implausible results. Correction for rates of IHD death gave slightly different relative survival estimates for lung, oesophagus and colorectal cancers. For lung cancer, when the population hazard was inflated for smoking, survival estimates were increased. Results agreed with the consensus that relative survival is usually preferable. However, for some cancers, relative survival might be inaccurate (e.g. lung and prostate). Likely solutions include enhancing life tables to include other demographic variables than age and sex, and to stratify relative survival calculation by cause of death.},

  abstract        = {Survival of patients with colon and rectal cancer has improved in all Nordic countries during the past decades. The aim of this study was to further assess survival trends in patients with colon and rectal cancer in the Nordic countries by age at diagnosis and to present additional survival measures. Data on colon and rectal cancer cases diagnosed in the Nordic countries between 1990 and 2016 were obtained from the NORDCAN database. Relative survival was estimated using flexible parametric models. Both age-standardized and age-specific measures for women and men were estimated from the models, as well as reference-adjusted crude probabilities of death and life-years lost. The five-year age-standardized relative survival of colon and rectal cancer patients continued to improve for women and men in all Nordic countries, from around 50% in 1990 to about 70% at the end of the study period. In general, survival was similar across age and sex. The largest improvement was seen for Danish men and women with rectal cancer, from 41% to 69% and from 43% to 71%, respectively. The age-standardized and reference-adjusted five-year crude probability of death in colon cancer ranged from 30% to 36% across countries, and for rectal cancer from 20% to 33%. The average number of age-standardized and reference-adjusted life-years lost ranged between six and nine years. There were substantial improvements in colon and rectal cancer survival in all Nordic countries 1990-2016. Of special note is that the previously observed survival disadvantage in Denmark is no longer present.},

  abstract        = {When interested in studying the effect of a treatment (or other exposure) on a time-to-event outcome, the most popular approach is to estimate survival probabilities using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In the presence of confounding, regression models are fitted, and results are often summarised as hazard ratios. However, despite their broad use, hazard ratios are frequently misinterpreted as relative risks instead of relative rates. We discuss measures for summarising the analysis from a regression model that overcome some of the limitations associated with hazard ratios. Such measures are the standardised survival probabilities for treated and untreated: survival probabilities if everyone in the population received treatment and if everyone did not. The difference between treatment arms can be calculated to provide a measure for the treatment effect. Using publicly available data on breast cancer, we demonstrated the usefulness of standardised survival probabilities for comparing the experience between treated and untreated after adjusting for confounding. We also showed that additional important research questions can be addressed by standardising among subgroups of the total population. Standardised survival probabilities are a useful way to report the treatment effect while adjusting for confounding and have an informative interpretation in terms of risk.},

Rates may additionally be affected by selection bias caused by the requirement that a cohort have a minimum lookback window, i.e. observation time prior to start of at-risk follow-up. Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated incorporating published population reference rates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), using Poisson regression with rates in CPRD GOLD contrasted to ONS rates, stratified by age, calendar year and sex. An overall SMR was estimated along with SMRs presented for cohorts with different lookback windows (1, 2, 5, 10 years). SMRs were stratified by calendar year, length of follow-up and age group. Mortality rates in a random sample of 1 million CPRD GOLD patients were slightly lower than the national population [SMR = 0.980 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.973, 0.987)]. Cohorts with observational lookback had SMRs below one [1 year of lookback; SMR = 0.905 (0.898, 0.912), 2 years; SMR = 0.881 (0.874, 0.888), 5 years; SMR = 0.849 (0.841, 0.857), 10 years; SMR = 0.837 (0.827, 0.847)]. Mortality rates in the first two years after patient entry into CPRD were higher than the general population, while SMRs dropped below one thereafter. Mortality rates in CPRD, using simple entry requirements, are similar to rates seen in the English population. The requirement of at least a single year of lookback results in lower mortality rates compared to national estimates.},

Information governance restrictions inhibit the active dissemination of individual level data to accompany published manuscripts. Realistic, high-fidelity time-to-event synthetic data can aid in the acceleration of methodological developments in survival analysis and beyond by enabling researchers to access and test published methods using data similar to that which they were developed on. We present methods to accurately emulate the covariate patterns and survival times found in real-world datasets using synthetic data techniques, without compromising patient privacy. We model the joint covariate distribution of the original data using covariate specific sequential conditional regression models, then fit a complex flexible parametric survival model from which to generate survival times conditional on individual covariate patterns. We recreate the administrative censoring mechanism using the last observed follow-up date information from the initial dataset. Metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the synthetic data, and the non-identifiability of individuals from the original dataset, are presented. We successfully create a synthetic version of an example colon cancer dataset consisting of 9064 patients which aims to show good similarity to both covariate distributions and survival times from the original data, without containing any exact information from the original data, therefore allowing them to be published openly alongside research. We evaluate the effectiveness of the methods for constructing synthetic data, as well as providing evidence that there is minimal risk that a given patient from the original data could be identified from their individual unique patient information. Synthetic datasets using this methodology could be made available alongside published research without breaching data privacy protocols, and allow for data and code to be made available alongside methodological or applied manuscripts to greatly improve the transparency and accessibility of medical research.},

Stage-specific survival differences are driven by differences in short-term prognosis, meaning estimated survival metrics using period analysis are unlikely to be sensitive to imputed historical stage data. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for lung, colon and breast cancer. To represent missing data patterns in less complete registry data, we artificially inflated the proportion of missing stage information conditional on stage at diagnosis and calendar year of diagnosis. Period analysis was applied and missing stage at diagnosis information was imputed under four different conditions to emulate extreme imputed stage distributions. We fit a flexible parametric model for each cancer stage on the excess hazard scale and the differences in stage-specific marginal relative survival were assessed. Estimates were also obtained from non-parametric approaches for validation. There was little difference between the 10-year stage-specific marginal relative survival estimates, regardless of the assumed historical stage distribution. When conducting a period analysis, multiple imputation can be used to obtain stage-specific long-term estimates of relative survival, even when the historical stage information is largely incomplete.},

It is a useful measure for summarizing the impact of a cancer diagnosis on an individual's life expectancy. However, it is less useful for making comparisons of cancer survival across groups or over time, because the LLE is influenced by both mortality due to cancer and other causes and the life expectancy in the general population. We present an approach for making LLE estimates comparable across groups and over time by using reference expected mortality rates with flexible parametric relative survival models. The approach is illustrated by estimating temporal trends in LLE of patients with colon cancer in Sweden. The life expectancy of Swedish patients with colon cancer has improved, but the LLE has not decreased to the same extent because the life expectancy in the general population has also increased. When using a fixed population and other-cause mortality, that is, a reference-adjusted approach, the LLE decreases over time. For example, using 2010 mortality rates as the reference, the LLE for females diagnosed at age 65 decreased from 11.3 if diagnosed in 1976 to 7.2 if diagnosed in 2010, and from 3.9 to 1.9 years for women 85 years old at diagnosis. The reference-adjusted LLE is useful for making comparisons across calendar time, or groups, because differences in other-cause mortality are removed. The reference-adjusted approach enhances the use of LLE as a comparative measure.},

The population mortality is assumed to be known (fixed), i.e. measured without uncertainty. This could have implications for the estimated standard errors (SE) of any measures obtained within a relative survival framework, such as relative survival (RS) ratios and the loss in life expectancy (LLE). We evaluated the existing approach to estimate SE of RS and the LLE in comparison to if uncertainty in the population mortality was taken into account. The uncertainty from the population mortality was incorporated using parametric bootstrap approach. The analysis was performed with different levels of stratification and sizes of the general population used for creating expected mortality rates. Using these expected mortality rates, SEs of 5-year RS and the LLE for colon cancer patients in Sweden were estimated. Ignoring uncertainty in the general population mortality rates had negligible (less than 1%) impact on the SEs of 5-year RS and LLE, when the expected mortality rates were based on the whole general population, i.e. all people living in a country or region. However, the smaller population used for creating the expected mortality rates, the larger impact. For a general population reduced to 0.05% of the original size and stratified by age, sex, year and region, the relative precision for 5-year RS was 41% for males diagnosed at age 85. For the LLE the impact was more substantial with a relative precision of 1286%. The relative precision for marginal estimates of 5-year RS was 3% and 30% and for the LLE 22% and 313% when the general population was reduced to 0.5% and 0.05% of the original size, respectively. When the general population mortality rates are based on the whole population, the uncertainty in the estimates of the expected measures can be ignored. However, when based on a smaller population, this uncertainty should be taken into account, otherwise SEs may be too small, particularly for marginal values, and, therefore, confidence intervals too narrow.},

  abstract        = {A recent overview of cancer survival trends 1990-2016 in the Nordic countries reported continued improvements in age-standardized breast cancer survival among women. The aim was to estimate age-specific survival trends over calendar time, including life-years lost, to evaluate if improvements have benefited patients across all ages in the Nordic countries. Data on breast cancers diagnosed 1990-2016 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden were obtained from the NORDCAN database. Age-standardized and age-specific relative survival (RS) was estimated using flexible parametric models, as was reference-adjusted crude probabilities of death and life-years lost. Age-standardized period estimates of 5-year RS in women diagnosed with breast cancer ranged from 87% to 90% and 10-year RS from 74% to 85%. Ten-year RS increased with 15-18 percentage points from 1990 to 2016, except in Sweden (+9 percentage points) which had the highest survival in 1990. The largest improvements were observed in Denmark, where a previous survival disadvantage diminished. Most recent 5-year crude probabilities of cancer death ranged from 9% (Finland, Sweden) to 12% (Denmark, Iceland), and life-years lost from 3.3 years (Finland) to 4.6 years (Denmark). Although survival improvements were consistent across different ages, women aged ≥70 years had the lowest RS in all countries. Period estimates of 5-year RS were 94-95% in age 55 years and 84-89% in age 75 years, while 10-year RS were 88-91% in age 55 years and 69-84% in age 75 years. Women aged 40 years lost on average 11.0-13.8 years, while women lost 3.8-6.0 years if aged 55 and 1.9-3.5 years if aged 75 years. Survival for Nordic women with breast cancer improved from 1990 to 2016 in all age groups, albeit with larger country variation among older women where survival was also lower. Women over 70 years of age have not had the same survival improvement as women of younger age.},

  abstract        = {There are situations when we need to model multiple time-scales in survival analysis. A usual approach in this setting would involve fitting Cox or Poisson models to a time-split dataset. However, this leads to large datasets and can be computationally intensive when model fitting, especially if interest lies in displaying how the estimated hazard rate or survival change along multiple time-scales continuously. We propose to use flexible parametric survival models on the log hazard scale as an alternative method when modelling data with multiple time-scales. By choosing one of the time-scales as reference, and rewriting other time-scales as a function of this reference time-scale, users can avoid time-splitting of the data. Through case-studies we demonstrate the usefulness of this method and provide examples of graphical representations of estimated hazard rates and survival proportions. The model gives nearly identical results to using a Poisson model, without requiring time-splitting. Flexible parametric survival models are a powerful tool for modelling multiple time-scales. This method does not require splitting the data into small time-intervals, and therefore saves time, helps avoid technological limitations and reduces room for error.},

We investigated differences in quality of AMI care and survival between patients with and without previous cancer diagnoses. A retrospective cohort study using Virtual Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative data. Patients aged 40+ years hospitalized in England with AMI between January 2010 and March 2018 were assessed, ascertaining previous cancers diagnosed within 15 years. Multivariable regression was used to assess effects of cancer diagnosis, time, stage, and site on international quality indicators and mortality. Of 512 388 patients with AMI (mean age, 69.3 years; 33.5% women), 42 187 (8.2%) had previous cancers. Patients with cancer had significantly lower use of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (mean percentage point decrease [mppd], 2.6% [95% CI, 1.8-3.4]) and lower overall composite care (mppd, 1.2% [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]). Poorer quality indicator attainment was observed in patients with cancer diagnosed in the last year (mppd, 1.4% [95% CI, 1.8-1.0]), with later stage disease (mppd, 2.5% [95% CI, 3.3-1.4]), and with lung cancer (mppd, 2.2% [95% CI, 3.0-1.3]). Twelve-month all-cause survival was 90.5% in noncancer controls and 86.3% in adjusted counterfactual controls. Differences in post-AMI survival were driven by cancer-related deaths. Modeling improving quality indicator attainment to noncancer patient levels showed modest 12-month survival benefits (lung cancer, 0.6%; other cancers, 0.3%). Measures of quality of AMI care are poorer in patients with cancer, with lower use of secondary prevention medications. Findings are primarily driven by differences in age and comorbidities between cancer and noncancer populations and attenuated after adjustment. The largest impact was observed in recent cancer diagnoses (<1 year) and lung cancer. Further investigation will determine whether differences reflect appropriate management according to cancer prognosis or whether opportunities to improve AMI outcomes in patients with cancer exist.},

Depending on the research question of interest and the information contained in the data, different multi-state structures and modelling choices can be applied. We aim to explore different research questions using a series of multi-state models of increasing complexity when studying repeated prescriptions data, while also evaluating different modelling choices. We develop a series of research questions regarding the probability of being under antidepressant medication across time using multi-state models, among Swedish women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 18,313) and an age-matched population comparison group of cancer-free women (n = 92,454) using a register-based database (Breast Cancer Data Base Sweden 2.0). Research questions were formulated ranging from simple to more composite ones. Depending on the research question, multi-state models were built with structures ranging from simpler ones, like single-event survival analysis and competing risks, up to complex bidirectional and recurrent multi-state structures that take into account the recurring start and stop of medication. We also investigate modelling choices, such as choosing a time-scale for the transition rates and borrowing information across transitions. Each structure has its own utility and answers a specific research question. However, the more complex structures (bidirectional, recurrent) enable accounting for the intermittent nature of prescribed medication data. These structures deliver estimates of the probability of being under medication and total time spent under medication over the follow-up period. Sensitivity analyses over different definitions of the medication cycle and different choices of timescale when modelling the transition intensity rates show that the estimates of total probabilities of being in a medication cycle over follow-up derived from the complex structures are quite stable. Each research question requires the definition of an appropriate multi-state structure, with more composite ones requiring such an increase in the complexity of the multi-state structure. When a research question is related with an outcome of interest that repeatedly changes over time, such as the medication status based on prescribed medication, the use of novel multi-state models of adequate complexity coupled with sensible modelling choices can successfully address composite, more realistic research questions.},

The aim of the study is to investigate the presentation and outcomes of hospital admission with acute HF in a national cohort of patients with prior cancer. This retrospective, population-based cohort study identified 221 953 patients admitted to a hospital in England for HF during 2012-2018 (12 867 with a breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer diagnosis in the previous 10 years). We examined the impact of cancer on (i) HF presentation and in-hospital mortality, (ii) place of care, (iii) HF medication prescribing, and (iv) post-discharge survival, using propensity score weighting and model-based adjustment. Heart failure presentation was similar between cancer and non-cancer patients. A lower percentage of patients with prior cancer were cared for in a cardiology ward [-2.4% age point difference (ppd) (95% CI -3.3, -1.6)] or were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ACEi/ARB) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [-2.1 ppd (-3.3, -0.9)] than non-cancer patients. Survival after HF discharge was poor with median survival of 1.6 years in prior cancer and 2.6 years in non-cancer patients. Mortality in prior cancer patients was driven primarily by non-cancer causes (68% of post-discharge deaths). Survival in prior cancer patients presenting with acute HF was poor, with a significant proportion due to non-cancer causes of death. Despite this, cardiologists were less likely to manage cancer patients with HF. Cancer patients who develop HF were less likely to be prescribed guideline-based HF medications compared with non-cancer patients. This was particularly driven by patients with a poorer cancer prognosis.},

A range of different survival measures exist, each serving different purposes and targeting different audiences. It is important that routine publications expand on current practice and provide estimates on a wider range of survival measures. We examine the feasibility of automated production of such statistics. We used data on 23 cancer sites obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). We propose an automated way of estimating flexible parametric relative survival models and calculating estimates of net survival, crude probabilities, and loss in life expectancy across many cancer sites and subgroups of patients. For 21 of 23 cancer sites, we were able to estimate survival models without assuming proportional hazards. Reliable estimates of all desired measures were obtained for all cancer sites. It may be challenging to implement new survival measures in routine publications as it can require the application of modeling techniques. We propose a way of automating the production of such statistics and show that we can obtain reliable estimates across a range of measures and subgroups of patients.},

  abstract        = {Different parametric survival models can lead to widely discordant extrapolations and decision uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analyses. The use of excess hazard (EH) methods, which incorporate general population mortality data, has the potential to reduce model uncertainty. This review highlights key practical considerations of EH methods for estimating long-term survival. Demonstration of methods used a case study of 686 patients from the German Breast Cancer Study Group, followed for a maximum of 7.3 y and divided into low (1/2) and high (3) grade cancers. Seven standard parametric survival models were fit to each group separately. The same 7 distributions were then used in an EH framework, which incorporated general population mortality rates, and fitted both with and without a cure parameter. Survival extrapolations, restricted mean survival time (RMST), and difference in RMST between high and low grades were compared up to 30 years along with Akaike information criterion goodness-of-fit and cure fraction estimates. The sensitivity of the EH models to lifetable misspecification was investigated. In our case study, variability in survival extrapolations was extensive across the standard models, with 30-y RMST ranging from 7.5 to 14.3 y. Incorporation of general population mortality rates using EH cure methods substantially reduced model uncertainty, whereas EH models without cure had less of an effect. Long-term treatment effects approached the null for most models but at varying rates. Lifetable misspecification had minimal effect on RMST differences. EH methods may be useful for survival extrapolation, and in cancer, EHs may decrease over time and be easier to extrapolate than all-cause hazards. EH cure models may be helpful when cure is plausible and likely to result in less extrapolation variability. In health economic modeling, to help anchor long-term survival extrapolation, it has been recommended that survival models incorporate background mortality rates using excess hazard (EH) methods.We present a thorough description of EH methods with and without the assumption of cure and demonstrate user-friendly software to aid researchers wishing to use these methods.EH models are applied to a case study, and we demonstrate that EHs are easier to extrapolate and that the use of the EH cure model, when cure is plausible, can reduce extrapolation variability.EH methods are relatively robust to lifetable misspecification.},

  abstract        = {To describe the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), multiple comorbidities and social deprivation in patients with a potentially curable cancer in 20 English Cancer Alliances. This National Registry Dataset Analysis used national cancer registry data and CVD databases to describe rates of CVD, comorbidities and social deprivation in patients diagnosed with a potentially curable malignancy (stage I-III breast cancer, stage I-III colon cancer, stage I-III rectal cancer, stage I-III prostate cancer, stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer, stage I-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, stage I-IV Hodgkin lymphoma) between 2013 and 2018. Outcome measures included observation of CVD prevalence, other comorbidities (evaluated by the Charlson Comorbidity Index) and deprivation (using the Index of Multiple Deprivation) according to tumour site and allocation to Cancer Alliance. Patients were allocated to CVD prevalence tertiles (minimum: <33.3rd percentile; middle: 33.3rd to 66.6th percentile; maximum: >66.6th percentile). In total, 634 240 patients with a potentially curable malignancy were eligible. The total CVD prevalence for all cancer sites varied between 13.4% (CVD n = 2058; 95% confidence interval 12.8, 13.9) and 19.6% (CVD n = 7818; 95% confidence interval 19.2, 20.0) between Cancer Alliances. CVD prevalence showed regional variation both for male (16-26%) and female patients (8-16%) towards higher CVD prevalence in northern Cancer Alliances. Similar variation was observed for social deprivation, with the proportion of cancer patients being identified as most deprived varying between 3.3% and 32.2%, depending on Cancer Alliance. The variation between Cancer Alliance for total comorbidities was much smaller. Social deprivation, CVD and other comorbidities in patients with a potentially curable malignancy in England show significant regional variations, which may partly contribute to differences observed in treatments and outcomes.},

  abstract        = {In population-based cancer studies it is common to try to isolate the impact of cancer by estimating net survival. Net survival is defined as the probability of surviving cancer in the absence of any other-causes of death. Net survival can be estimated either in the cause-specific or relative survival framework. Cause-specific survival considers deaths from the cancer as the event of interest. Relative survival incorporates general population expected mortality rates to represent the other-cause mortality rate. Estimation approaches in both frameworks are impacted by the systematic removal of patients from the risk-set, commonly referred to as informative censoring in the cause-specific framework. In the relative survival framework, the Pohar Perme estimator combats the effect of this systematic removal of patients through weighting. When the two frameworks have been compared, informative censoring is rarely accounted for in the cause-specific framework. We investigate the use of weighted cause-specific Kaplan-Meier estimates to overcome the impact of informative censoring and compared approaches to defining weights. Individuals remaining in the risk-set are upweighted using their predicted other-cause survival obtained through various model-based approaches. We also compare weights derived from expected mortality rates. We applied the approaches to US cancer registry data and conducted a simulation study. Using weighted cause-specific estimates provides a better estimate of marginal net survival. The unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimates have a similar bias to the Ederer II method for relative survival. Weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates are unbiased and similar to the Pohar Perme estimator. There was little variation between the several weighting approaches. In comparisons of cause-specific and relative survival, it is important to compare "like-with-like", therefore, a weighted approach should be considered for both frameworks. If researchers are interested in obtaining net measures in a cause-specific framework, then weighting is needed to account for informative censoring.},

A potential solution to this is to borrow strength from larger populations from the same source, but this has not formally been investigated. Using data on 451,222 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink on the presence/absence of intellectual disability and type 2 diabetes mellitus, we compared stratified and combined flexible parametric models, and Chiang's methods, for calculating life expectancy. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Delta method, Chiang's adjusted life table approach and bootstrapping. The flexible parametric models allowed calculation of life expectancy by exact age and beyond traditional life expectancy age thresholds. The combined model that fit age interaction effects as a spline term provided less bias and greater statistical precision for small covariate subgroups by borrowing strength from the larger subgroups. However, careful consideration of the distribution of events in the smallest group was needed. Life expectancy is a simple measure to compare health differences between populations. The use of combined flexible parametric methods to calculate life expectancy in small samples has shown promising results by allowing life expectancy to be modelled by exact age, greater statistical precision, less bias and prediction of different covariate patterns without stratification. We recommend further investigation of their application for both policymakers and researchers.},

This involves first estimating the predictor effects using data from all individuals (full dataset) and then re-estimating the baseline using a subset of the most recent data whilst constraining the predictor effects to remain the same. In this article, we demonstrate how temporal recalibration can be applied in competing risk settings by recalibrating each cause-specific (or subdistribution) hazard model separately. We illustrate this using an example of colon cancer survival with data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Data from patients diagnosed in 1995-2004 were used to fit two models for deaths due to colon cancer and other causes respectively. We discuss considerations that need to be made in order to apply temporal recalibration such as the choice of data used in the recalibration step. We also demonstrate how to assess the calibration of these models in new data for patients diagnosed subsequently in 2005. Comparison was made to a standard analysis (when improvements over time are not taken into account) and a period analysis which is similar to temporal recalibration but differs in the data used to estimate the predictor effects. The 10-year calibration plots demonstrated that using the standard approach over-estimated the risk of death due to colon cancer and the total risk of death and that calibration was improved using temporal recalibration or period analysis.},

  abstract        = {Parametric models are used to estimate the lifetime benefit of an intervention beyond the range of trial follow-up. Recent recommendations have suggested more flexible survival approaches and the use of external data when extrapolating. Both of these can be realized by using flexible parametric relative survival modeling. The overall aim of this article is to introduce and contrast various approaches for applying constraints on the long-term disease-related (excess) mortality including cure models and evaluate the consequent implications for extrapolation. We describe flexible parametric relative survival modeling approaches. We then introduce various options for constraining the long-term excess mortality and compare the performance of each method in simulated data. These methods include fitting a standard flexible parametric relative survival model, enforcing statistical cure, and forcing the long-term excess mortality to converge to a constant. We simulate various scenarios, including where statistical cure is reasonable and where the long-term excess mortality persists. The compared approaches showed similar survival fits within the follow-up period. However, when extrapolating the all-cause survival beyond trial follow-up, there is variation depending on the assumption made about the long-term excess mortality. Altering the time point from which the excess mortality is constrained enables further flexibility. The various constraints can lead to applying explicit assumptions when extrapolating, which could lead to more plausible survival extrapolations. The inclusion of general population mortality directly into the model-building process, which is possible for all considered approaches, should be adopted more widely in survival extrapolation in health technology assessment.},

LE (C)and LLE are useful summary measures of survival in population-based cancer studies, but require information on the mortality in the general population. Our method addresses the challenge of incorporating the uncertainty of expected mortality rates when using a sample from the general population. To illustrate the approach, we estimated LE (C)and LLE for patients diagnosed with colon and breast cancer in Sweden. General population mortality rates were based on a random sample drawn from comparators of a matched cohort. Flexible parametric survival models were used to model the mortality among cancer patients and the mortality in the random sample from the general population. Based on the models, LE (C)and LLE together with their variances were estimated. The results were compared with those obtained using fixed expected mortality rates. By accounting for the uncertainty of expected mortality rates, the proposed method ensures more accurate estimates of variances and, therefore, confidence intervals of LE (C)and LLE for cancer patients. This is particularly valuable for older patients and some cancer types, where underestimation of the variance can be substantial when the entire general population data are not accessible. The method can be implemented using existing software, making it accessible for use in various cancer studies. The provided example of Stata code further facilitates its adoption.},

Forcing a hazard ratio (HR) to 1 does not necessarily estimate loss of individual-level treatment effect accurately because of HR selection bias. A simulation study was designed to explore the behavior of marginal HRs under a waning conditional (individual-level) treatment effect and demonstrate bias in forcing a marginal HR to 1 when the estimand is "survival difference with individual-level waning". Data were simulated under 4 parameter combinations (varying prognostic strength of heterogeneity and treatment effect). Time-varying marginal HRs were estimated in scenarios where the true conditional HR attenuated to 1. Restricted mean survival time differences, estimated having constrained the marginal HR to 1, were compared with true values to assess bias induced by marginal constraints. Under loss of conditional treatment effect, the marginal HR took a value >1 because of covariate imbalances. Constraining this value to 1 lead to restricted mean survival time difference bias of up to 0.8 years (57% increase). Inflation of effect size estimates also increased with the magnitude of initial protective treatment effect. Important differences exist between survival extrapolations assuming marginal versus conditional treatment effect waning. When a marginal HR is constrained to 1 to assess efficacy under individual-level treatment effect waning, the survival benefits associated with the new treatment will be overestimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be underestimated.},

In health technology assessment, estimates of the unconfounded overall survival benefit associated with the new treatment are needed. Several switching adjustment methods have been advocated in the literature, some of which have been used in health technology assessment. However, it is unclear which methods are likely to produce least bias in realistic RCT-based scenarios. We simulated RCTs in which switching, associated with patient prognosis, was permitted. Treatment effect size and time dependency, switching proportions and disease severity were varied across scenarios. We assessed the performance of alternative adjustment methods based upon bias, coverage and mean squared error, related to the estimation of true restricted mean survival in the absence of switching in the control group. We found that when the treatment effect was not time-dependent, rank preserving structural failure time models (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation methods produced low levels of bias. However, in the presence of a time-dependent treatment effect, these methods produced higher levels of bias, similar to those produced by an inverse probability of censoring weights method. The inverse probability of censoring weights and structural nested models produced high levels of bias when switching proportions exceeded 85%. A simplified two-stage Weibull method produced low bias across all scenarios and provided the treatment switching mechanism is suitable, represents an appropriate adjustment method.},

  abstract        = {Guidelines are frequently used in an attempt to influence the performance of health professionals, and a national agency has been established in England and Wales to develop and disseminate guidelines. Professionals prefer short guidelines that highlight key recommendations, but whether such guidelines are more likely to be implemented is unknown. To determine the relative impact of the dissemination of full guidelines, reduced guidelines in the form of prioritized review criteria, and review criteria supplemented by feedback. Cluster randomised controlled trial, with an incomplete block design. Eighty-one general practices in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, North Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. The practices received one of the study interventions, either for care of adults with asthma or for care of people with angina. Data were collected before and after the interventions, the process measures being adherence to ten recommendations about asthma and 14 about angina, and outcome measures being scores in response to an asthma symptom questionnaire or the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, and levels of patient satisfaction. There were no consistent differences between the interventions in stimulating improvements in performance as indicated by adherence to the recommendations for asthma or angina. Patients with angina in practices that had received criteria or criteria plus feedback reported better symptom control. The dissemination of guidelines in the format of prioritized review criteria does not increase adherence to recommendations in comparison with the traditional guideline format, and the further provision of feedback has minimal additional effect.},

However, no population-based study has estimated this excess risk compared with matched control participants. To assess risk for arterial and venous thrombosis in patients with MPNs compared with matched control participants. Matched cohort study. Population-based setting in Sweden from 1987 to 2009, with follow-up to 2010. 9429 patients with MPNs and 35ÃÂÃÂ 820 matched control participants. The primary outcomes were rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. Flexible parametric models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and cumulative incidence with 95% CIs. The HRs for arterial thrombosis among patients with MPNs compared with control participants at 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.4), 2.0 (CI, 1.8 to 2.2), and 1.5 (CI, 1.4 to 1.6), respectively. The corresponding HRs for venous thrombosis were 9.7 (CI, 7.8 to 12.0), 4.7 (CI, 4.0 to 5.4), and 3.2 (CI, 2.9 to 3.6). The rate was significantly elevated across all age groups and was similar among MPN subtypes. The 5-year cumulative incidence of thrombosis in patients with MPNs showed an initial rapid increase followed by gentler increases during follow-up. The HR for venous thrombosis decreased during more recent calendar periods. No information on individual laboratory results or treatment. Patients with MPNs across all age groups have a significantly increased rate of arterial and venous thrombosis compared with matched control participants, with the highest rates at and shortly after diagnosis. Decreases in the rate of venous thrombosis over time likely reflect advances in clinical management.

We evaluated whether the improvements have been similar across countries, major cancer types, and age groups. Using population-based data from the five Nordic cancer registries recorded in the NORDCAN database, we included a cohort of 1,525,854 men and 1,378,470 women diagnosed with cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) during 2002-2021, and followed for death until 2021. We estimated 5-year relative survival (RS) in 5-year calendar periods, and percentage points (pp) differences in 5-year RS from 2002-2006 until 2017-2021. Separate analyses were performed for eight cancer sites (i.e. colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, cervix uteri, kidney, prostate, and melanoma of skin). Five-year RS improved across nearly all cancer sites in all countries (except Iceland), with absolute differences across age groups ranging from 1 to 21 pp (all cancer sites), 2 to 20 pp (colorectum), -1 to 36 pp (pancreas), 2 to 28 pp (lung), 0 to 9 pp (breast), -11 to 26 pp (cervix uteri), 2 to 44 pp (kidney), -2 to 23 pp (prostate) and -3 to 30 pp (skin melanoma). The oldest patients (80-89 years) exhibited lower survival across all countries and sites, although with varying improvements over time. Nordic cancer patients have generally experienced substantial improvements in cancer survival during the last two decades, including major cancer sites and age groups. Although survival has improved over time, older patients remain at a lower cancer survival compared to younger patients.},

It is of interest to know if these improvements are observed in all ages and for both women and men. Patients diagnosed with CMM in the Nordic countries in 1990-2016 were identified in the NORDCAN database. Flexible parametric relative survival models were fitted, except for Iceland where a non-parametric Pohar-Perme approach was used. A range of survival metrics were estimated by sex, both age-standardised and age-specific. The 5-year relative survival improved in all countries, in both women and men and across age. While the improvement was more pronounced in men, women still had a higher survival at the end of the study period. The survival was generally high, with age-standardised estimates of 5-year relative survival towards the end of the study period ranging from 85% in Icelandic men to 95% in Danish women. The age-standardised and reference-adjusted 5-year crude probability of death due to CMM ranged from 5% in Danish and Swedish women to 13% in Icelandic men. Although survival following CMM was relatively high in the Nordic countries in 1990, continued improvements in survival were observed throughout the study period in both women and men and across age.},

  abstract        = {The occurrence of a range of health outcomes following myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the long-term risk of major health outcomes following MI and generate sociodemographic stratified risk charts in order to inform care recommendations in the post-MI period and underpin shared decision making. This nationwide cohort study includes all individuals aged ≥18 years admitted to one of 229 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between 1 January 2008 and 31 January 2017 (final follow-up 27 March 2017). We analysed 11 non-fatal health outcomes (subsequent MI and first hospitalisation for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, severe bleeding, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, dementia, depression, and cancer) and all-cause mortality. Of the 55,619,430 population of England, 34,116,257 individuals contributing to 145,912,852 hospitalisations were included (mean age 41.7 years (standard deviation [SD 26.1]); n = 14,747,198 (44.2%) male). There were 433,361 individuals with MI (mean age 67.4 years [SD 14.4)]; n = 283,742 (65.5%) male). Following MI, all-cause mortality was the most frequent event (adjusted cumulative incidence at 9 years 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] [37.6,37.9]), followed by heart failure (29.6%; 95% CI [29.4,29.7]), renal failure (27.2%; 95% CI [27.0,27.4]), atrial fibrillation (22.3%; 95% CI [22.2,22.5]), severe bleeding (19.0%; 95% CI [18.8,19.1]), diabetes (17.0%; 95% CI [16.9,17.1]), cancer (13.5%; 95% CI [13.3,13.6]), cerebrovascular disease (12.5%; 95% CI [12.4,12.7]), depression (8.9%; 95% CI [8.7,9.0]), dementia (7.8%; 95% CI [7.7,7.9]), subsequent MI (7.1%; 95% CI [7.0,7.2]), and peripheral arterial disease (6.5%; 95% CI [6.4,6.6]). Compared with a risk-set matched population of 2,001,310 individuals, first hospitalisation of all non-fatal health outcomes were increased after MI, except for dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.01; 95% CI [0.99,1.02];p = 0.468) and cancer (aHR 0.56; 95% CI [0.56,0.57];p < 0.001). The study includes data from secondary care only-as such diagnoses made outside of secondary care may have been missed leading to the potential underestimation of the total burden of disease following MI. In this study, up to a third of patients with MI developed heart failure or renal failure, 7% had another MI, and 38% died within 9 years (compared with 35% deaths among matched individuals). The incidence of all health outcomes, except dementia and cancer, was higher than expected during the normal life course without MI following adjustment for age, sex, year, and socioeconomic deprivation. Efforts targeted to prevent or limit the accrual of chronic, multisystem disease states following MI are needed and should be guided by the demographic-specific risk charts derived in this study.},
