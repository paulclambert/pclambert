# `stpm3` fully supports factor variables

In `stpm3` there is now full support for factor variables including for time-dependent effects.
This makes predictions much easier. In addition, `standsurv` has been updated to be compatible 
with `stpm3` making marginal predictions also much easier.

We first load the Rotterdam breast cancer data and then use `stset` to declare the survival time and event indicator.

```stata
<<dd_do>>
use https://www.pclambert.net/data/rott3, clear
stset os, f(osi==1) scale(12) exit(time 120)
<</dd_do>>
```

The `scale(12)` option converts the times recorded in months to years.

To fit an `stpm3` model with a binary covariate  we could use,

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 hormon, scale(lncumhazard) df(5) 
<</dd_do>>
```

The equivalent model using factor variables is, 

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 i.hormon, scale(lncumhazard) df(5) 
<</dd_do>>
```

You can also include factor variables as a time-dependent effect.

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 i.hormon, scale(lncumhazard) df(5) ///
                tvc(i.hormon) dftvc(3)
<</dd_do>>
```

You can incorporate interactions into both the main effect and interactions with time using `tvc()`.

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 i.hormon##i.grade, scale(lncumhazard) df(5) ///
                tvc(i.hormon##i.grade) dftvc(3) baselevels
<</dd_do>>
```

I strongly recommend using factor variables. When the model becomes complex, with interactions, time-dependent effects etc, 
then  predictions usinff `predict` or `standsurv` become much simpler.
