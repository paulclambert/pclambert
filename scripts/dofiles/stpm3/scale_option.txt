# The `scale()` option has changed

In `stpm2` the choice of options when using the `scale()` option included `hazard` and `odds`.
These really meant **log** cumulative hazard and **log** odds respectively.

In `stpm3` you need to refer to these models as `scale(lncumhazard)` or
`scale(lnodds)`. This is because `stpm3` allows models to be fitted on 
the log hazard scale (`scale(lnhazard)`) and thus there is a need to distinguish between models
on the log cumulative hazard and log hazard scales.


We first load the example Rotterdam breast cancer data (`rott3.dta`)
and then use `stset` to declare the survival time and event indicator.

```stata
<<dd_do>>
use https://www.pclambert.net/data/rott2b, clear
stset os, f(osi==1) scale(12) exit(time 120)
<</dd_do>>
```

The `scale(12)` option converts the times recorded in months to years.

To fit an `stpm2` model we would use,

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm2 hormon, scale(hazard) df(5) 
<</dd_do>>
```

The equivalent model in `stpm3` is, 

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 hormon, scale(lncumhazard) df(5) 
<</dd_do>>
```

Note the log-likelihoods are identical as are the coefficients/standard errors for `hormon`.
Note that different basis functions are used, so the coefficients for the spline terms
are different. However, predicted values for the same covariate pattern will not differ.


To fit a model on the log hazard scale use `scale(lnhazard)`,

```stata
<<dd_do>>
stpm3 hormon, scale(lnhazard) df(5) 
<</dd_do>>
```
