  abstract  = {This paper considers the quantitative synthesis of published comparative
	study results when the outcome measures used in the individual studies
	and the way in which they are reported varies between studies. Whilst
	the former difficulty may be overcome, at least to a limited extent,
	by the use of standardized effects, the latter is often more problematic.
	Two potential solutions to this problem are; sensitivity analyses
	and a fully Bayesian approach, in which pertinent external information
	is included. Both approaches are illustrated using the results of
	two systematic reviews and meta-analyses which consider the difference
	in mean change in systolic blood pressure and the difference in physical
	functioning between an intervention and control group. The two examples
	illustrate that by adopting a fully Bayesian approach, as opposed
	to undertaking sensitivity analyses assuming fixed values for unknown
	parameters, the overall intervention effect can be estimated with
	greater uncertainty, but that assessing the sensitivity of results
	to choice of prior distributions in such analyses is crucial.},

Organizational factors such as bed occupancy have been associated with an increased incidence of CDI; however, the data are sparse, and the association has not been widely demonstrated. We investigated the association of bed occupancy and CDI within a large hospital organization in the United Kingdom. To establish whether bed occupancy rates are a significant risk factor for CDI in the general ward setting. A retrospective cohort study was carried out on data from 2006 to 2008. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression modeling was used to examine the strength and significance of the associations. Variables included patient characteristics, antibiotic policy exposure, case mix, and bed occupancy rates. A total of 1,589 cases of hospital-acquired CDI were diagnosed (1.7% of admissions), with an overall infection rate of 2.16 per 1,000 patient-days. Median bed occupancy was 93.3% (interquartile range, 83.3%-100%) Univariate and multivariate analyses showed positive and statistically significant associations. In the adjusted model, patients on wards with occupancy rates of 80%-89.9% had rates of CDI that were 56% higher (hazard ratio, 1.56 [95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.04]; P < .001) compared with baseline (0%-69.9% occupancy). CDI rates were 55% higher for patients on wards with maximal bed occupancy (100%). There is strong evidence of an association between high bed occupancy and CDI. Without effective interventions at high levels of bed occupancy, the economic benefits sought from reducing bed numbers may be negated by the increased risk of CDI.},

  abstract    = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: When the mortality among a cancer patient group
	returns to the same level as in the general population, that is,
	the patients no longer experience excess mortality, the patients
	still alive are considered "statistically cured". Cure models can
	be used to estimate the cure proportion as well as the survival function
	of the "uncured". One limitation of parametric cure models is that
	the functional form of the survival of the "uncured" has to be specified.
	It can sometimes be hard to find a survival function flexible enough
	to fit the observed data, for example, when there is high excess
	hazard within a few months from diagnosis, which is common among
	older age groups. This has led to the exclusion of older age groups
	in population-based cancer studies using cure models. METHODS: Here
	we have extended the flexible parametric survival model to incorporate
	cure as a special case to estimate the cure proportion and the survival
	of the "uncured". Flexible parametric survival models use splines
	to model the underlying hazard function, and therefore no parametric
	distribution has to be specified. RESULTS: We have compared the fit
	from standard cure models to our flexible cure model, using data
	on colon cancer patients in Finland. This new method gives similar
	results to a standard cure model, when it is reliable, and better
	fit when the standard cure model gives biased estimates. CONCLUSIONS:
	Cure models within the framework of flexible parametric models enables
	cure modelling when standard models give biased estimates. These
	flexible cure models enable inclusion of older age groups and can
	give stage-specific estimates, which is not always possible from
	parametric cure models.},

The ICBP SURVMARK-2 study is an international partnership aiming to quantify and explore the reasons behind survival differences across high-income countries. However, the magnitude and relevance of differences in cancer survival between countries have been questioned, as it is argued that observed survival variations may be explained, at least in part, by differences in cancer registration practice, completeness and the availability and quality of the respective data sources. As part of the ICBP SURVMARK-2 study, we used a simulation approach to better understand how differences in completeness, the characteristics of those missed and inclusion of cases found from death certificates can impact on cancer survival estimates. Bias in 1- and 5-year net survival estimates for 216 simulated scenarios is presented. Out of the investigated factors, the proportion of cases not registered through sources other than death certificates, had the largest impact on survival estimates. Our results show that the differences in registration practice between participating countries could in our most extreme scenarios explain only a part of the largest observed differences in cancer survival.},

Many cancer registries use death certificates to identify additional cases not captured through other routine sources, to hopefully add a large proportion of the missed cases. Cases notified through this route, who would not have been captured without death certificate information, are referred to as Death Certificate Initiated (DCI) cases. Inclusion of DCI cases in cancer registries increases completeness and is important for estimating cancer incidence. However, inclusion of DCI cases will generally lead to biased estimates of cancer survival, but the same is often also true if excluding DCI cases. Missed cases are probably not a random sample of all cancer cases, but rather cases with poor prognosis. Further, DCI cases have poorer prognosis than missed cases in general, since they have all died with cancer mentioned on the death certificates. We performed a simulation study to estimate the impact of including or excluding DCI cases on cancer survival estimates, under different scenarios. We demonstrated that including DCI cases underestimates survival. The exclusion of DCI cases gives unbiased survival estimates if missed cases are a random sample of all cancer cases, while survival is overestimated if these have poorer prognosis. In our most extreme scenarios, with 25 % of cases initially missed, the usual practice of including DCI cases underestimated 5-year survival by at most 3 percentage points.},

When deaths are ascertained by linkage with vital statistics registers, some may be missed, and such individuals will wrongly appear to be long-term survivors, and survival will be overestimated. Interval-specific relative survival that levels off above one indicates that the survival among the cancer patients is better than expected, which could be due to the presence of immortals. We included colon cancer cases diagnosed in 1995-1999 within the 19 jurisdictions in seven countries participating in ICBP SURVMARK-2, with follow-up information available until end-2015. Interval-specific relative survival was estimated for each year following diagnosis, by country and age group at diagnosis. The interval-specific relative survival levels off at 1 for all countries and age groups, with two exceptions: for the age group diagnosed at age 75 years and above in Ireland, and, to a lesser extent, in New Zealand. Overall, a subset of immortals are not apparent in the early years within the ICBP SURVMARK-2 study, except for possibly in Ireland. We suggest this approach as one strategy of exploring the existence of immortals, and to be part of routine checks of cancer registry data.},

  abstract        = {Comparisons of population-based cancer survival between countries are important to benchmark the overall effectiveness of cancer management. The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP) Survmark-2 study aims to compare survival in seven high-income countries across eight cancer sites and explore reasons for the observed differences. A critical aspect in ensuring comparability in the reported survival estimates are similarities in practice across cancer registries. While ICBP Survmark-2 has shown these differences are unlikely to explain the observed differences in cancer-specific survival between countries, it is important to keep in mind potential biases linked to registry practice and understand their likely impact. Based on experiences gained within ICBP Survmark-2, we have developed a set of recommendations that seek to optimally harmonise cancer registry datasets to improve future benchmarking exercises. Our recommendations stem from considering the impact on cancer survival estimates in five key areas: (1) the completeness of the registry and the availability of registration sources; (2) the inclusion of death certification as a source of identifying cases; (3) the specification of the date of incidence; (4) the approach to handling multiple primary tumours and (5) the quality of linkage of cases to the deaths register. These recommendations seek to improve comparability whilst maintaining the opportunity to understand and act upon international variations in outcomes among cancer patients.},

It is a useful measure for summarizing the impact of a cancer diagnosis on an individual's life expectancy. However, it is less useful for making comparisons of cancer survival across groups or over time, because the LLE is influenced by both mortality due to cancer and other causes and the life expectancy in the general population. We present an approach for making LLE estimates comparable across groups and over time by using reference expected mortality rates with flexible parametric relative survival models. The approach is illustrated by estimating temporal trends in LLE of patients with colon cancer in Sweden. The life expectancy of Swedish patients with colon cancer has improved, but the LLE has not decreased to the same extent because the life expectancy in the general population has also increased. When using a fixed population and other-cause mortality, that is, a reference-adjusted approach, the LLE decreases over time. For example, using 2010 mortality rates as the reference, the LLE for females diagnosed at age 65 decreased from 11.3 if diagnosed in 1976 to 7.2 if diagnosed in 2010, and from 3.9 to 1.9 years for women 85 years old at diagnosis. The reference-adjusted LLE is useful for making comparisons across calendar time, or groups, because differences in other-cause mortality are removed. The reference-adjusted approach enhances the use of LLE as a comparative measure.},

There were no consistent differences between the interventions in stimulating improvements in performance as indicated by adherence to the recommendations for asthma or angina. Patients with angina in practices that had received criteria or criteria plus feedback reported better symptom control. The dissemination of guidelines in the format of prioritized review criteria does not increase adherence to recommendations in comparison with the traditional guideline format, and the further provision of feedback has minimal additional effect.},

A usual approach in this setting would involve fitting Cox or Poisson models to a time-split dataset. However, this leads to large datasets and can be computationally intensive when model fitting, especially if interest lies in displaying how the estimated hazard rate or survival change along multiple time-scales continuously. We propose to use flexible parametric survival models on the log hazard scale as an alternative method when modelling data with multiple time-scales. By choosing one of the time-scales as reference, and rewriting other time-scales as a function of this reference time-scale, users can avoid time-splitting of the data. Through case-studies we demonstrate the usefulness of this method and provide examples of graphical representations of estimated hazard rates and survival proportions. The model gives nearly identical results to using a Poisson model, without requiring time-splitting. Flexible parametric survival models are a powerful tool for modelling multiple time-scales. This method does not require splitting the data into small time-intervals, and therefore saves time, helps avoid technological limitations and reduces room for error.},

  abstract        = {Prognostic models are typically developed in studies covering long time periods. However, if more recent years have seen improvements in survival, then using the full dataset may lead to out-of-date survival predictions. Period analysis addresses this by developing the model in a subset of the data from a recent time window, but results in a reduction of sample size. We propose a new approach, called temporal recalibration, to combine the advantages of period analysis and full cohort analysis. This approach develops a model in the entire dataset and then recalibrates the baseline survival using a period analysis sample.The approaches are demonstrated utilizing a prognostic model in colon cancer built using both Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric survival models with data from 1996-2005 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database. Comparison of model predictions with observed survival estimates were made for new patients subsequently diagnosed in 2006 and followed-up until 2015. Period analysis and temporal recalibration provided more up-to-date survival predictions that more closely matched observed survival in subsequent data than the standard full cohort models. In addition, temporal recalibration provided more precise estimates of predictor effects. Prognostic models are typically developed using a full cohort analysis that can result in out-of-date long-term survival estimates when survival has improved in recent years. Temporal recalibration is a simple method to address this, which can be used when developing and updating prognostic models to ensure survival predictions are more closely calibrated with the observed survival of individuals diagnosed subsequently.},

This involves first estimating the predictor effects using data from all individuals (full dataset) and then re-estimating the baseline using a subset of the most recent data whilst constraining the predictor effects to remain the same. In this article, we demonstrate how temporal recalibration can be applied in competing risk settings by recalibrating each cause-specific (or subdistribution) hazard model separately. We illustrate this using an example of colon cancer survival with data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program. Data from patients diagnosed in 1995-2004 were used to fit two models for deaths due to colon cancer and other causes respectively. We discuss considerations that need to be made in order to apply temporal recalibration such as the choice of data used in the recalibration step. We also demonstrate how to assess the calibration of these models in new data for patients diagnosed subsequently in 2005. Comparison was made to a standard analysis (when improvements over time are not taken into account) and a period analysis which is similar to temporal recalibration but differs in the data used to estimate the predictor effects. The 10-year calibration plots demonstrated that using the standard approach over-estimated the risk of death due to colon cancer and the total risk of death and that calibration was improved using temporal recalibration or period analysis.},

  abstract     = {Expected or reference mortality rates are commonly used in the calculation of measures such as relative survival in population-based cancer survival studies and standardized mortality ratios. These expected rates are usually presented by age, sex and calendar year. In certain situations, stratification of expected rates by other factors is required to avoid potential bias if interest lies in quantifying measures by such factors, for example, socioeconomic status. If data on a population level are not available, information from a control population could be used to adjust expected rates. We present two approaches for adjusting expected mortality rates using information from a control population; a Poisson generalised linear model, and a flexible parametric survival model. We used a control group from BCBaSe, a Swedish register-based matched breast cancer cohort with diagnoses between 1992 and 2012, to illustrate the two methods using socioeconomic status as a risk factor of interest. Results showed that Poisson and flexible parametric survival approaches estimate similar adjusted mortality rates by socioeconomic status. Additional uncertainty involved in the methods to estimate stratified expected mortality rates described in this study can be accounted for using a parametric bootstrap, but may make little difference if using a large control population.},

We identified 112,502 hospital admissions for AMI in England 2010-2017 from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) disease registry and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for 95,509 patients with a previous cancer diagnosis up to 15 years prior to admission. Cancer diagnoses were identified from the National Cancer Registration Dataset (NCRD). We calculated the percentage of AMI admissions captured by each source and examined patient characteristics associated with source of ascertainment. Survival analysis assessed whether differences in survival between case-ascertainment sources could be explained by patient characteristics.57,265 (50.9%) AMI admissions in patients with a prior diagnosis of cancer were captured in both MINAP and HES. Patients captured in both sources were younger, more likely to have ST-segment elevation MI and had better prognosis, with lower mortality rates up to 9 years after AMI admission compared with patients captured in only one source. The percentage of admissions captured in both data sources improved over time. Cancer characteristics (site, stage and grade) had little effect on how AMI was captured. MINAP and HES define different populations of patients with AMI. However, cancer characteristics do not substantially impact on case-ascertainment. These findings support a strategy of using multiple linked data sources for observational cardio-oncological research into AMI.},

The aim of the study is to investigate the presentation and outcomes of hospital admission with acute HF in a national cohort of patients with prior cancer. This retrospective, population-based cohort study identified 221 953 patients admitted to a hospital in England for HF during 2012-2018 (12 867 with a breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer diagnosis in the previous 10 years). We examined the impact of cancer on (i) HF presentation and in-hospital mortality, (ii) place of care, (iii) HF medication prescribing, and (iv) post-discharge survival, using propensity score weighting and model-based adjustment. Heart failure presentation was similar between cancer and non-cancer patients. A lower percentage of patients with prior cancer were cared for in a cardiology ward [-2.4% age point difference (ppd) (95% CI -3.3, -1.6)] or were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ACEi/ARB) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [-2.1 ppd (-3.3, -0.9)] than non-cancer patients. Survival after HF discharge was poor with median survival of 1.6 years in prior cancer and 2.6 years in non-cancer patients. Mortality in prior cancer patients was driven primarily by non-cancer causes (68% of post-discharge deaths). Survival in prior cancer patients presenting with acute HF was poor, with a significant proportion due to non-cancer causes of death. Despite this, cardiologists were less likely to manage cancer patients with HF.

	is often problematic due to the distribution of such data; for example,
	strongly right skewed with a significant percentage of zero-cost
	observations. An additional problem associated with modelling costs
	over time is that cost observations measured on the same individual
	at different time points will usually be correlated. In this study
	we compare the performance of four different multilevel/hierarchical
	models (which allow for both the within-subject and between-subject
	variability) for analysing healthcare costs in a cohort of individuals
	with early inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) who were followed-up annually
	over a 5-year time period from 1990/1991. The hierarchical models
	fitted included linear regression models and two-part models with
	log-transformed costs, and two-part model with gamma regression and
	a log link. The cohort was split into a learning sample, to fit the
	different models, and a test sample to assess the predictive ability
	of these models. To obtain predicted costs on the original cost scale
	(rather than the log-cost scale) two different retransformation factors
	were applied. All analyses were carried out using Bayesian Markov

  abstract        = {Most of the few published models used to obtain small-area estimates of relative survival are based on a generalized linear model with piecewise constant hazards under a Bayesian formulation. Limitations of these models include the need to artificially split the time scale, restricted ability to include continuous covariates, and limited predictive capacity. Here, an alternative Bayesian approach is proposed: a spatial flexible parametric relative survival model. This overcomes previous limitations by combining the benefits of flexible parametric models: the smooth, well-fitting baseline hazard functions and predictive ability, with the Bayesian benefits of robust and reliable small-area estimates. Both spatially structured and unstructured frailty components are included. Spatial smoothing is conducted using the intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior. The model was applied to breast, colorectal, and lung cancer data from the Queensland Cancer Registry across 478 geographical areas. Advantages of this approach include the ease of including more realistic complexity, the feasibility of using individual-level input data, and the capacity to conduct overall, cause-specific, and relative survival analysis within the same framework. Spatial flexible parametric survival models have great potential for exploring small-area survival inequalities, and we hope to stimulate further use of these models within wider contexts.

	We describe a flexible parametric approach for the survival submodel

	a B-spline formulation, illustrating insensitivity of parameter estimates

  abstract        = {A now common goal in medical research is to investigate the inter-relationships between a repeatedly measured biomarker, measured with error, and the time to an event of interest. This form of question can be tackled with a joint longitudinal-survival model, with the most common approach combining a longitudinal mixed effects model with a proportional hazards survival model, where the models are linked through shared random effects. In this article, we look at incorporating delayed entry (left truncation), which has received relatively little attention. The extension to delayed entry requires a second set of numerical integration, beyond that required in a standard joint model. We therefore implement two sets of fully adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature with nested Gauss-Kronrod quadrature (to allow time-dependent association structures), conducted simultaneously, to evaluate the likelihood. We evaluate fully adaptive quadrature compared with previously proposed non-adaptive quadrature through a simulation study, showing substantial improvements, both in terms of minimising bias and reducing computation time. We further investigate, through simulation, the consequences of misspecifying the longitudinal trajectory and its impact on estimates of association. Our scenarios showed the current value association structure to be very robust, compared with the rate of change that we found to be highly sensitive showing that assuming a simpler trend when the truth is more complex can lead to substantial bias. With emphasis on flexible parametric approaches, we generalise previous models by proposing the use of polynomials or splines to capture the longitudinal trend and restricted cubic splines to model the baseline log hazard function. The methods are illustrated on a dataset of breast cancer patients, modelling mammographic density jointly with survival, where we show how to incorporate density measurements prior to the at-risk period, to make use of all the available information.

	4,761 women 40-59 years of age and registered with primary breast
	cancer in a Swedish population-based clinical register during 1993-2003,
	and 2,3805 women without breast cancer. Information on socioeconomic
	standing was obtained from a social database 1 year prior and 3 and
	5 years following the diagnosis. In Conditional Poisson Regression
	models, risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
	estimated to assess the impact of a breast cancer diagnosis.Three
	years after diagnosis, women who had had breast cancer more often
	had received sickness benefits (RR = 1.49, 95\% CI 1.40-1.58) or
	disability pension (RR = 1.47, 95\% CI 1.37-1.58) than had women
	without breast cancer. We found no effect on income (RR = 0.99),
	welfare payments (RR = 0.98), or marital status (RR = 1.02). A higher
	use of sickness benefits and disability pension was evident in all
	stages of the disease, although the difference in use of sickness
	benefits decreased after 5 years, whereas the difference in disability
	pension increased. For woman with early stage breast cancer, the
	sickness absence was higher following diagnosis among those with
	low education, who had undergone mastectomy, and had received chemo-
	or hormonal therapy. Neither tumour size nor presence of lymph nodes
	metastasis was associated with sickness absence after adjustment
	for treatment.Even in early stage breast cancer, a diagnosis negatively
	influences working capacity both 3 and 5 years after diagnosis, and
	it seems that the type of treatment received had the largest impact.
	A greater focus needs to be put on rehabilitation of breast cancer
	patients, work-place adaptations and research on long-term sequelae

Whether excess occurrence of neurodegenerative disease occurred among recipients of blood from a subset of donors was also investigated. As a positive control, transmission of chronic hepatitis before and after implementation of hepatitis C virus screening was assessed. Among included patients, 2.9% received a transfusion from a donor diagnosed with one of the studied neurodegenerative diseases. No evidence of transmission of any of these diseases was found, regardless of approach. The hazard ratio for dementia in recipients of blood from donors with dementia versus recipients of blood from healthy donors was 1.04 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.09). Corresponding estimates for Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease were 0.99 (CI, 0.85 to 1.15) and 0.94 (CI, 0.78 to 1.14), respectively. Hepatitis transmission was detected before but not after implementation of hepatitis C virus screening.

In total, 448 CML patients were enrolled, and the SF-36 Health Survey was used to compare generic HRQOL profiles. Symptoms were also assessed. HRQOL comparisons were adjusted for key possible confounders. The median age of patients was 57 years and the median time of imatinib treatment was 5 years (range 3-9 years). The largest HRQOL differences were found in younger patients. In particular, patients aged between 18 and 39 years had marked impairments in role limitations because of physical and emotional problems, respectively: -22.6 (P < .001), -22.3 (P < .001). Patients with CML age 60 or older had a HRQOL profile very similar to that reported by the general population. Women had a worse profile than men when each were compared with their peers in the general population. Fatigue was the most frequently reported symptom. The HRQOL of CML patients is comparable with that of population norms in many areas, however, younger and female patients seem to report the major limitations.},

  abstract    = {PURPOSE: Studies of cancer patient survival typically report relative
	survival or cause-specific survival using data from patients diagnosed
	many years in the past. From a risk-communication perspective, such
	measures are suboptimal for several reasons; their interpretation
	is not transparent for non-specialists, competing causes of death
	are ignored and the estimates are unsuitable to predict the outcome
	of newly diagnosed patients. In this paper, we discuss the relative
	merits of recently developed alternatives to traditionally reported
	measures of cancer patient survival. METHODS: In a relative survival
	framework, using a period approach, we estimated probabilities of
	death in the presence of competing risks. To illustrate the methods,
	we present estimates of survival among 23,353 initially untreated,
	or hormonally treated men with intermediate- or high-risk localized
	prostate cancer using Swedish population-based data. RESULTS: Among
	all groups of newly diagnosed patients, the probability of dying
	from prostate cancer, accounting for competing risks, was lower compared
	to the corresponding estimates where competing risks were ignored.
	Accounting for competing deaths was particularly important for patients
	aged more than 70 years at diagnosis in order to avoid overestimating
	the risk of dying from prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that
	period estimates of survival, accounting for competing risks, provide
	the tools to communicate the actual risk that cancer patients, diagnosed
	today, face to die from their disease. Such measures should offer
	a more useful basis for risk communication between patients and clinicians
	and we advocate their use as means to answer prognostic questions.},

	by socioeconomic status have been demonstrated in several populations,
	but the underlying reasons for the differences are not well understood.
	By simultaneously estimating the proportion of patients cured from
	colon cancer and the survival times of the 'uncured' we hope to increase
	understanding of how socioeconomic status affects survival following
	a diagnosis of colon cancer. METHODS: We conducted a population-based
	cohort study of 58,873 patients diagnosed with colon cancer in Sweden
	1965-2000. Socioeconomic status was classified based on occupation.
	We fitted mixture cure models and Poisson regression models adjusted
	for age, sex and calendar period. RESULTS: We observed higher excess
	mortality, lower proportion cured and shorter survival times among
	the uncured in patients from lower socioeconomic groups compared
	to the highest socioeconomic group. There was no evidence that the
	gap between the socioeconomic groups reduced over time. Farmers had
	the lowest odds of cure (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95\% confidence interval
	(CI) 0.75-0.95) compared to higher non-manual workers followed by
	self-employed (0.91, 0.81-1.03), manual workers (0.93, 0.85-1.03)
	and lower non-manual workers (0.98, 0.89-1.08). CONCLUSION: Patients
	from lower socioeconomic groups in Sweden experience worse survival
	following a diagnosis of colon cancer. Differences exist in both
	the cure proportion and the survival time of the uncured, suggesting
	that socioeconomic differences cannot be attributed solely to lead
	time bias.Although this study has furthered our understanding of
	socioeconomic differences in survival, more detailed studies are
	required in order to identify, and subsequently remove, the underlying

  abstract        = {Individual participant data (IPD) from multiple sources allows external validation of a prognostic model across multiple populations. Often this reveals poor calibration, potentially causing poor predictive performance in some populations. However, rather than discarding the model outright, it may be possible to modify the model to improve performance using recalibration techniques. We use IPD meta-analysis to identify the simplest method to achieve good model performance. We examine four options for recalibrating an existing time-to-event model across multiple populations: (i) shifting the baseline hazard by a constant, (ii) re-estimating the shape of the baseline hazard, (iii) adjusting the prognostic index as a whole, and (iv) adjusting individual predictor effects. For each strategy, IPD meta-analysis examines (heterogeneity in) model performance across populations. Additionally, the probability of achieving good performance in a new population can be calculated allowing ranking of recalibration methods. In an applied example, IPD meta-analysis reveals that the existing model had poor calibration in some populations, and large heterogeneity across populations. However, re-estimation of the intercept substantially improved the expected calibration in new populations, and reduced between-population heterogeneity. Comparing recalibration strategies showed that re-estimating both the magnitude and shape of the baseline hazard gave the highest predicted probability of good performance in a new population. In conclusion, IPD meta-analysis allows a prognostic model to be externally validated in multiple settings, and enables recalibration strategies to be compared and ranked to decide on the least aggressive recalibration strategy to achieve acceptable external model performance without discarding existing model information.},

	investigated familial coaggregation of AD and PD by conducting a
	systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed was searched for relevant
	studies published through the end of October 2012. Three independent
	investigators screened publications and extracted data. Relative
	risk estimates of AD risk associated with family history of PD or
	parkinsonism, or PD risk associated with family history of AD or
	dementia, were summarized into metaestimates using random effects
	models. Heterogeneity and publication bias were tested using Higgins'
	and Egger's tests, respectively. Results: We included 16 studies
	in the review, with 14 included in any meta-analysis. AD risk associated
	with family history of PD yielded a summary hazard ratio of 1.18
	(95\% CI: 1.00-1.39) based on 5 reconstructed cohort studies and
	a summary odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 (95\% CI: 0.92-2.12) based on 7
	case-control studies. PD risk associated with family history of AD
	yielded a summary OR of 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.49-1.16) based on 3 studies.
	There was no significant heterogeneity among studies, nor significant
	publication bias. Conclusions: There may be familial coaggregation
	of AD and PD, although the association was modest and only apparent
	when studying AD risk associated with family history of PD.},

  abstract        = {The relation between selenium status and risk of Type 2 diabetes is controversial. We aimed to evaluate associations of serum selenium, a marker of dietary selenium, with measures of glucose metabolism and risk of diabetes. We used data from a population-based, longitudinal cohort of 1925 Swedish men who were 50 years old and did not have diabetes at baseline in the 1970s. At baseline, an intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed and, at a follow-up examination after 20 years, an oral glucose tolerance test and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp for the assessment of insulin sensitivity were conducted. At baseline, the mean (standard deviation) selenium concentration was 75.6 (14.3) μg/l. During 20 years of follow-up, 88 incident cases of diabetes occurred in 1024 participants with follow-up data. Baseline serum selenium levels were not associated with risk of diabetes (odds ratio 1.06; 95% CI 0.83-1.38). Higher selenium levels were associated with lower early insulin response (standardized β -0.08; 95% CI -0.14 to -0.03) at baseline after adjusting for potential confounders, but not with any other measures of β-cell function or insulin sensitivity at baseline or follow-up. The association with early insulin response was non-significant after taking multiple testing into account. Our results do not support a role of dietary selenium in the development of disturbances in glucose metabolism or diabetes in older individuals.},

	DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on development and evaluation
	of probabilistic, comprehensive economic decision analytic model,
	from screening to death. SETTING: A hypothetical population, aged
	45 at time of screening, with above average risk of diabetes. DATA
	SOURCES: Published clinical trials and epidemiological studies retrieved
	from electronic bibliographic databases; supplementary data obtained
	from the Department of Health statistics for England and Wales, the
	screening those at risk (STAR) study, and the Leicester division
	of the ADDITION study. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model
	was developed to simulate the long term effects of each screening
	strategy, in terms of both clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes.
	The base case model assumed a 50 year time horizon with discounting
	of both costs and benefits at 3.5\%. Sensitivity analyses were carried
	out to investigate assumptions of the model and to identify which
	model inputs had most impact on the results. RESULTS: Estimated costs
	for each quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained (discounted at
	3.5\% a year for both costs and benefits) were pound14,150 (euro17
	560; $27,860) for screening for type 2 diabetes, pound6242 for screening
	for diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance followed by lifestyle
	interventions, and pound7023 for screening for diabetes and impaired
	glucose tolerance followed by pharmacological interventions, all
	compared with no screening. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of
	pound20,000 the probability of the intervention being cost effective
	was 49\%, 93\%, and 85\% for each of the active screening strategies
	respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for type 2 diabetes and impaired
	glucose tolerance, with appropriate intervention for those with impaired
	glucose tolerance, in an above average risk population aged 45, seems
	to be cost effective. The cost effectiveness of a policy of screening
	for diabetes alone, which offered no intervention to those with impaired
	glucose tolerance, is still uncertain.},

	METHODS: The gold standard for the cumulative relative survival ratio
	is the weighted average of age-specific cumulative relative survival
	ratios, with weights proportional to numbers of patients at diagnosis.
	Mathematics and representative empirical materials from the population-based
	Finnish Cancer Registry were studied for the different relative survival
	methods and compared with the gold standard. RESULTS: The theoretical
	and empirical results show a good agreement between the method suggested
	in 1959 by Ederer and Heise (the so-called Ederer II method) and
	the gold standard. This result is in part due the fact that as follow-up
	time increases the conditional (annual) relative survival ratios
	become increasingly more independent of age. Moreover, the dependence
	between the excess mortality due to cancer and the baseline general
	mortality does not introduce an important enough selection in practice
	to cause a notable bias. CONCLUSION: The use of the method by Ederer
	and Heise, multiplication of the annual relative survival ratios,
	instead of direct standardisation, should be considered in future
	applications. This would be particularly important for the long-term
	follow-up when age-specific relative survival is not available in
	the oldest age categories.},

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the long-term risk of major health outcomes following MI and generate sociodemographic stratified risk charts in order to inform care recommendations in the post-MI period and underpin shared decision making. This nationwide cohort study includes all individuals aged ≥18 years admitted to one of 229 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England between 1 January 2008 and 31 January 2017 (final follow-up 27 March 2017). We analysed 11 non-fatal health outcomes (subsequent MI and first hospitalisation for heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, severe bleeding, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, dementia, depression, and cancer) and all-cause mortality. Of the 55,619,430 population of England, 34,116,257 individuals contributing to 145,912,852 hospitalisations were included (mean age 41.7 years (standard deviation [SD 26.1]); n = 14,747,198 (44.2%) male). There were 433,361 individuals with MI (mean age 67.4 years [SD 14.4)]; n = 283,742 (65.5%) male). Following MI, all-cause mortality was the most frequent event (adjusted cumulative incidence at 9 years 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] [37.6,37.9]), followed by heart failure (29.6%; 95% CI [29.4,29.7]), renal failure (27.2%; 95% CI [27.0,27.4]), atrial fibrillation (22.3%; 95% CI [22.2,22.5]), severe bleeding (19.0%; 95% CI [18.8,19.1]), diabetes (17.0%; 95% CI [16.9,17.1]), cancer (13.5%; 95% CI [13.3,13.6]), cerebrovascular disease (12.5%; 95% CI [12.4,12.7]), depression (8.9%; 95% CI [8.7,9.0]), dementia (7.8%; 95% CI [7.7,7.9]), subsequent MI (7.1%; 95% CI [7.0,7.2]), and peripheral arterial disease (6.5%; 95% CI [6.4,6.6]). Compared with a risk-set matched population of 2,001,310 individuals, first hospitalisation of all non-fatal health outcomes were increased after MI, except for dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.01; 95% CI [0.99,1.02];p = 0.468) and cancer (aHR 0.56; 95% CI [0.56,0.57];p < 0.001). The study includes data from secondary care only-as such diagnoses made outside of secondary care may have been missed leading to the potential underestimation of the total burden of disease following MI. In this study, up to a third of patients with MI developed heart failure or renal failure, 7% had another MI, and 38% died within 9 years (compared with 35% deaths among matched individuals). The incidence of all health outcomes, except dementia and cancer, was higher than expected during the normal life course without MI following adjustment for age, sex, year, and socioeconomic deprivation. Efforts targeted to prevent or limit the accrual of chronic, multisystem disease states following MI are needed and should be guided by the demographic-specific risk charts derived in this study.},

  abstract        = {Multi-state models are being increasingly used to capture complex disease pathways. The convenient formula of the exponential multi-state model can facilitate a quick and accessible understanding of the data. However, assuming time constant transition rates is not always plausible. On the other hand, obtaining predictions from a fitted model with time-dependent transitions can be challenging. One proposed solution is to utilise a general simulation algorithm to calculate predictions from a fitted multi-state model. Predictions obtained from an exponential multi-state model were compared to those obtained from two different parametric models and to non-parametric Aalen-Johansen estimates. The first comparative approach fitted a multi-state model with transition-specific distributions, chosen separately based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The second approach was a Royston-Parmar multi-state model with 4 degrees of freedom, which was chosen as a reference model flexible enough to capture complex hazard shapes. All quantities were obtained analytically for the exponential and Aalen-Johansen approaches. The transition rates for the two comparative approaches were also obtained analytically, while all other quantities were obtained from the fitted models via a general simulation algorithm. Metrics investigated were: transition probabilities, attributable mortality (AM), population attributable fraction (PAF) and expected length of stay. This work was performed on previously analysed hospital acquired infection (HAI) data. By definition, a HAI takes three days to develop and therefore selected metrics were also predicted from time 3 (delayed entry). Despite clear deviations from the constant transition rates assumption, the empirical estimates of the transition probabilities were approximated reasonably well by the exponential model. However, functions of the transition probabilities, e.g. AM and PAF, were not well approximated and the comparative models offered considerable improvements for these metrics. They also provided consistent predictions with the empirical estimates in the case of delayed entry time, unlike the exponential model. We conclude that methods and software are readily available for obtaining predictions from multi-state models that do not assume constant transition rates. The multistate package in Stata facilitates a range of predictions with confidence intervals, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data. User-friendly code is provided.},

  abstract    = {Background: Relative survival is an extensively used method in population
	based cancer studies as it provides a measure of survival without
	the need for accurate cause of death information. It gives an estimate
	for the probability of dying from cancer in the absence of other
	causes by estimating the excess mortality in the study population
	when compared to an external group. The external group is usually
	the general population within a country or state and mortality estimates
	are taken from national life tables that are broken down by age,
	sex, calendar year and, where applicable, race/ethnicity. One potential
	bias when using relative survival that is most often overlooked occurs
	when there are a high proportion of deaths due to a specific cancer
	in the external group. Methods: This paper uses data from the Finnish
	Cancer Registry to illustrate, through the use of a simple sensitivity
	analysis, the impact that specific cancer deaths in the population
	mortality figures can have on the estimate of relative survival.
	Results: We found that when examining specific diseases such as breast
	cancer and colon cancer, the proportion of deaths due to these specific
	cancers in the general population is so small in comparison to the
	total mortality that they make little difference to the relative
	survival estimates. However, prostate cancer proved to be an exception
	to this. For all cancer sites combined the sensitivity analysis illustrates
	a major limitation for this type of analysis, particularly with the
	older age groups. Conclusion: We recommend that, with a classification
	of diseases as wide as all cancer sites, relative survival should
	not be used without appropriate adjustment.},

	estimates of the absolute probabilities of death or discharge.The
	absolute probabilities of death or discharge are presented in graphical
	form showing the cause-specific cumulative incidence over time by

	alive generally occurred over a longer time period for babies of
	lower gestational age and smaller birthweight than for bigger babies.This

  abstract        = {A long-term, constant, protective treatment effect is a strong assumption when extrapolating survival beyond clinical trial follow-up; hence, sensitivity to treatment effect waning is commonly assessed for economic evaluations. Forcing a hazard ratio (HR) to 1 does not necessarily estimate loss of individual-level treatment effect accurately because of HR selection bias. A simulation study was designed to explore the behavior of marginal HRs under a waning conditional (individual-level) treatment effect and demonstrate bias in forcing a marginal HR to 1 when the estimand is "survival difference with individual-level waning". Data were simulated under 4 parameter combinations (varying prognostic strength of heterogeneity and treatment effect). Time-varying marginal HRs were estimated in scenarios where the true conditional HR attenuated to 1. Restricted mean survival time differences, estimated having constrained the marginal HR to 1, were compared with true values to assess bias induced by marginal constraints. Under loss of conditional treatment effect, the marginal HR took a value >1 because of covariate imbalances. Constraining this value to 1 lead to restricted mean survival time difference bias of up to 0.8 years (57% increase). Inflation of effect size estimates also increased with the magnitude of initial protective treatment effect. Important differences exist between survival extrapolations assuming marginal versus conditional treatment effect waning. When a marginal HR is constrained to 1 to assess efficacy under individual-level treatment effect waning, the survival benefits associated with the new treatment will be overestimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be underestimated.},

We evaluated whether the improvements have been similar across countries, major cancer types, and age groups. Using population-based data from the five Nordic cancer registries recorded in the NORDCAN database, we included a cohort of 1,525,854 men and 1,378,470 women diagnosed with cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) during 2002-2021, and followed for death until 2021. We estimated 5-year relative survival (RS) in 5-year calendar periods, and percentage points (pp) differences in 5-year RS from 2002-2006 until 2017-2021. Separate analyses were performed for eight cancer sites (i.e. colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, cervix uteri, kidney, prostate, and melanoma of skin). Five-year RS improved across nearly all cancer sites in all countries (except Iceland), with absolute differences across age groups ranging from 1 to 21 pp (all cancer sites), 2 to 20 pp (colorectum), -1 to 36 pp (pancreas), 2 to 28 pp (lung), 0 to 9 pp (breast), -11 to 26 pp (cervix uteri), 2 to 44 pp (kidney), -2 to 23 pp (prostate) and -3 to 30 pp (skin melanoma). The oldest patients (80-89 years) exhibited lower survival across all countries and sites, although with varying improvements over time. Nordic cancer patients have generally experienced substantial improvements in cancer survival during the last two decades, including major cancer sites and age groups. Although survival has improved over time, older patients remain at a lower cancer survival compared to younger patients.},

  abstract  = {Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with significant
	maternal and foetal morbidity. Measurement of blood pressure remains
	the standard way of identifying individuals at risk. There is growing
	interest in the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitors (ABPM),
	which can record an individual's blood pressure many times over a
	24-hour period. From a clinical perspective interest lies in the
	shape of the blood pressure profile over a 24-hour period and any
	differences in the profile between groups. We propose a two-level
	hierarchical linear model incorporating all ABPM data into a single
	model. We contrast a classical approach with a Bayesian approach
	using the results of a study of 206 pregnant women who were asked
	to wear an ABPM for 24 hours after referral to an obstetric day unit
	with high blood pressure. As the main interest lies in the shape
	of the profile, we use restricted cubic splines to model the mean
	profiles. The use of restricted cubic splines provides a flexible
	way to model the mean profiles and to make comparisons between groups.
	From examining the data and the fit of the model it is apparent that
	there were heterogeneous within-subject variances in that some women
	tend to have more variable blood pressure than others. Within the
	Bayesian framework it is relatively easy to incorporate a random
	effect to model the between-subject variation in the within-subject
	variances. Although there is substantial heterogeneity in the within-subject
	variances, allowing for this in the model has surprisingly little
	impact on the estimates of the mean profiles or their confidence/credible
	intervals. We thus demonstrate a powerful method for analysis of
	ABPM data and also demonstrate how heterogeneous within-subject variances
	can be modelled from a Bayesian perspective.},

	Establishing the total cost per patient is complex, as it requires
	information on resource use, which may come from a variety of different
	sources. This complexity may lead to considerable missing data, and
	can result in some patients only having partial cost information.
	In this paper we consider a clinical trial consisting of 351 patients
	with advanced non-small cell lung cancer comparing chemotherapy with
	standard palliative care. A subset of 115 patients was selected for
	the cost sub-study. Total cost was split into four components, for
	which resource use was collected. Complete resource data were available
	on 82 patients. For the remaining patients at least one of the cost
	components was missing. The objective of this paper is to develop
	a Bayesian approach which simultaneously models both the clinical
	effectiveness data and the cost data, by modelling the individual
	components. This also provides estimates of the cost-effectiveness
	in terms of the Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB) and Cost-Effectiveness
	Acceptability Curves (CEAC). We compare a number of different models
	of increasing complexity. The models estimate the interrelationships
	between the four cost components and survival, and thus enable a
	predictive distribution for each missing cost item to be obtained.},

	using flexible parametric relative survival models, enabling improved
	quantification of differences in survival. Crude probabilities were

	into that due to cancer and other causes and to estimate the number
	of "avoidable" deaths. Results: England had lower relative survival
	for all ages with the difference increasing with age. Much of the
	difference was due to higher excess mortality in England in the first
	few months after diagnosis. Older patients had a higher proportion
	of deaths due to other causes. At 5 years post diagnosis, a woman
	aged 85 in England had probabilities of 0.35 of dying of cancer and
	0.32 of dying of other causes, whilst in Norway they were 0.26 and
	0.35. By eight years the number of "avoidable" all-cause deaths in
	England was 1020 with the number of "avoidable" breast cancer related
	deaths 1488. Conclusion: Lower breast cancer survival in England
	is mainly due to higher mortality in the first year after diagnosis.
	Crude probabilities aid our understanding of the impact of disease
	on individual patients and help assess different treatment options.},

	rate is the sum of the underlying baseline mortality rate and the
	excess mortality rate due to the disease of interest. Previous models
	for relative survival have assumed that covariate effects act multiplicatively
	and have thus provided relative effects of differences between groups
	using excess mortality rate ratios. In this paper we consider (i)
	the use of an additive covariate model, which provides estimates
	of the absolute difference in the excess mortality rate; and (ii)
	the use of fractional polynomials in relative survival models for
	the baseline excess mortality rate and time-dependent effects. The
	approaches are illustrated using data on 115 331 female breast cancer
	patients diagnosed between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 1990. The
	use of additive covariate relative survival models can be useful
	in situations when the excess mortality rate is zero or slightly
	less than zero and can provide useful information from a public health
	perspective. The use of fractional polynomials has advantages over
	the usual piecewise estimation by providing smooth estimates of the
	baseline excess mortality rate and time-dependent effects for both
	the multiplicative and additive covariate models. All models presented
	in this paper can be estimated within a generalized linear models
	framework and thus can be implemented using standard software.},

	the equivalent individual patient data (IPD) analysis when interest
	lies in identification of binary patient characteristics related
	to treatment efficacy. DESIGN: A simulation study comparing meta-regression
	with IPD analyses of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: Twenty-seven
	different meta-analysis situations were simulated with 1000 repetitions
	in each case. The following parameters were varied: (1) the treatment
	effect magnitude for different patient risk groups; (2) sample sizes
	of individual studies; and (3) number of studies. The meta-regression
	and IPD results were then compared for each situation. RESULTS: The
	statistical power of meta-regression was dramatically and consistently
	lower than that of IPD analysis, with little agreement between the
	parameter estimates obtained from the two methods. Only in meta-analyses
	of large numbers of large trials, did meta-regression detect differential
	treatment effects between risk groups with any consistency. CONCLUSIONS:
	Meta-analysis of summary data may be adequate when estimating a single
	pooled treatment effect or investigating study level characteristics.
	However, when interest lies in investigating whether patient characteristics
	are related to treatment, IPD analysis will generally be necessary
	to discover any such relationships. In these situations practitioners
	should try to obtain individual-level data.},

  abstract  = {There has been a recent growth in the use of Bayesian methods in medical
	research. The main reasons for this are the development of computer
	intensive simulation based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC), increases in computing power and the introduction of powerful
	software such as WinBUGS. This has enabled increasingly complex models
	to be fitted. The ability to fit these complex models has led to
	MCMC methods being used as a convenient tool by frequentists, who
	may have no desire to be fully Bayesian.Often researchers want 'the
	data to dominate' when there is no prior information and thus attempt
	to use vague prior distributions. However, with small amounts of
	data the use of vague priors can be problematic. The results are
	potentially sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. In general
	there are fewer problems with location parameters. The main problem
	is with scale parameters. With scale parameters, not only does one
	have to decide the distributional form of the prior distribution,
	but also whether to put the prior distribution on the variance, standard
	deviation or precision.We have conducted a simulation study comparing
	the effects of 13 different prior distributions for the scale parameter
	on simulated random effects meta-analysis data. We varied the number
	of studies (5, 10 and 30) and compared three different between-study
	variances to give nine different simulation scenarios. One thousand
	data sets were generated for each scenario and each data set was
	analysed using the 13 different prior distributions. The frequentist
	properties of bias and coverage were investigated for the between-study
	variance and the effect size.The choice of prior distribution was
	crucial when there were just five studies. There was a large variation
	in the estimates of the between-study variance for the 13 different
	prior distributions. With a large number of studies the choice of
	prior distribution was less important. The effect size estimated
	was not biased, but the precision with which it was estimated varied
	with the choice of prior distribution leading to varying coverage
	intervals and, potentially, to different statistical inferences.
	Again there was less of a problem with a larger number of studies.
	There is a particular problem if the between-study variance is close
	to the boundary at zero, as MCMC results tend to produce upwardly
	biased estimates of the between-study variance, particularly if inferences
	are based on the posterior mean.The choice of 'vague' prior distribution
	can lead to a marked variation in results, particularly in small
	studies. Sensitivity to the choice of prior distribution should always
	be assessed.},

The hypothetical nature of this definition has led to confusion and incorrect interpretation. For any measure to be fair in terms of comparing cancer survival, then differences between population groups should depend only on differences in excess mortality rates due to the cancer and not differences in other-cause mortality rates or differences in the age distribution. We propose using crude probabilities of death and all-cause survival which incorporate reference expected mortality rates. This makes it possible to obtain marginal crude probabilities and all-cause probability of death that only differ between population groups due to excess mortality rate differences. Choices have to be made regarding what reference mortality rates to use and what age distribution to standardize to. We illustrate the method and some potential choices using data from England for men diagnosed with melanoma. Various marginal measures are presented and compared. The new measures help enhance understanding of cancer survival and are a complement to the more commonly used measures.},

Here, we investigate these methods in a new range of realistic scenarios, allowing conclusions to be made based upon a broader evidence base. We simulated randomised controlled trials incorporating prognosis-related treatment switching and investigated the impact of sample size, reduced switching proportions, disease severity, and alternative data-generating models on the performance of adjustment methods, assessed through a comparison of bias, mean squared error, and coverage, related to the estimation of true restricted mean survival in the absence of switching in the control group. Rank preserving structural failure time models, inverse probability of censoring weights, and two-stage methods consistently produced less bias than the intention-to-treat analysis. The switching proportion was confirmed to be a key determinant of bias: sample size and censoring proportion were relatively less important. It is critical to determine the size of the treatment effect in terms of an acceleration factor (rather than a hazard ratio) to provide information on the likely bias associated with rank-preserving structural failure time model adjustments. In general, inverse probability of censoring weight methods are more volatile than other adjustment methods.},

In health technology assessment, estimates of the unconfounded overall survival benefit associated with the new treatment are needed. Several switching adjustment methods have been advocated in the literature, some of which have been used in health technology assessment. However, it is unclear which methods are likely to produce least bias in realistic RCT-based scenarios. We simulated RCTs in which switching, associated with patient prognosis, was permitted. Treatment effect size and time dependency, switching proportions and disease severity were varied across scenarios. We assessed the performance of alternative adjustment methods based upon bias, coverage and mean squared error, related to the estimation of true restricted mean survival in the absence of switching in the control group. We found that when the treatment effect was not time-dependent, rank preserving structural failure time models (RPSFTM) and iterative parameter estimation methods produced low levels of bias. However, in the presence of a time-dependent treatment effect, these methods produced higher levels of bias, similar to those produced by an inverse probability of censoring weights method. The inverse probability of censoring weights and structural nested models produced high levels of bias when switching proportions exceeded 85%. A simplified two-stage Weibull method produced low bias across all scenarios and provided the treatment switching mechanism is suitable, represents an appropriate adjustment method.},

A total of 613 (23.6%) and 230 (8.8%) of 2600 subjects died of lymphoma and developed incident CVD, respectively. Median follow-up was 7.0 years (interquartile range 3.8-10.8 years). Older ages [hazard ratio (HR) for >75 versus ≤60 years 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-2.82 and HR for 61-75 versus ≤60 years 1.60; 95% CI 1.12-2.30], hypertension (HR 4.92; 95% CI 2.61-9.26), diabetes (HR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.87), and baseline use of aspirin (HR 5.30; 95% CI 3.93-7.16) were associated with an increased risk of incident CVD. In a subgroup of anticipated higher-risk patients (aged 61-75 years, smoked, had diabetes, and received doxorubicin), we found that they remained on average 7.9 (95% CI 7.2-8.8) years in the DLBCL state and 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-0.4) years in the CVD state, if they could be followed up for 10 years. The brief time in the CVD state is consistent with the high chance of death in patients who developed CVD. Other causes of death have overtaken DLBCL-related death after about 5 years. In this Asian population-based cohort, we found that incident CVDs can occur soon after DLBCL treatment and continued to occur throughout survivorship. Clinicians are advised to balance the risks and benefits of treatment choices to minimize the risk of CVD.},

  abstract        = {Parametric models are used to estimate the lifetime benefit of an intervention beyond the range of trial follow-up. Recent recommendations have suggested more flexible survival approaches and the use of external data when extrapolating. Both of these can be realized by using flexible parametric relative survival modeling. The overall aim of this article is to introduce and contrast various approaches for applying constraints on the long-term disease-related (excess) mortality including cure models and evaluate the consequent implications for extrapolation. We describe flexible parametric relative survival modeling approaches. We then introduce various options for constraining the long-term excess mortality and compare the performance of each method in simulated data. These methods include fitting a standard flexible parametric relative survival model, enforcing statistical cure, and forcing the long-term excess mortality to converge to a constant. We simulate various scenarios, including where statistical cure is reasonable and where the long-term excess mortality persists. The compared approaches showed similar survival fits within the follow-up period. However, when extrapolating the all-cause survival beyond trial follow-up, there is variation depending on the assumption made about the long-term excess mortality. Altering the time point from which the excess mortality is constrained enables further flexibility. The various constraints can lead to applying explicit assumptions when extrapolating, which could lead to more plausible survival extrapolations. The inclusion of general population mortality directly into the model-building process, which is possible for all considered approaches, should be adopted more widely in survival extrapolation in health technology assessment.},

  abstract        = {A relative survival approach is often used in population-based cancer studies, where other cause (or expected) mortality is assumed to be the same as the mortality in the general population, given a specific covariate pattern. The population mortality is assumed to be known (fixed), i.e. measured without uncertainty. This could have implications for the estimated standard errors (SE) of any measures obtained within a relative survival framework, such as relative survival (RS) ratios and the loss in life expectancy (LLE). We evaluated the existing approach to estimate SE of RS and the LLE in comparison to if uncertainty in the population mortality was taken into account. The uncertainty from the population mortality was incorporated using parametric bootstrap approach. The analysis was performed with different levels of stratification and sizes of the general population used for creating expected mortality rates. Using these expected mortality rates, SEs of 5-year RS and the LLE for colon cancer patients in Sweden were estimated. Ignoring uncertainty in the general population mortality rates had negligible (less than 1%) impact on the SEs of 5-year RS and LLE, when the expected mortality rates were based on the whole general population, i.e. all people living in a country or region. However, the smaller population used for creating the expected mortality rates, the larger impact. For a general population reduced to 0.05% of the original size and stratified by age, sex, year and region, the relative precision for 5-year RS was 41% for males diagnosed at age 85. For the LLE the impact was more substantial with a relative precision of 1286%. The relative precision for marginal estimates of 5-year RS was 3% and 30% and for the LLE 22% and 313% when the general population was reduced to 0.5% and 0.05% of the original size, respectively. When the general population mortality rates are based on the whole population, the uncertainty in the estimates of the expected measures can be ignored. However, when based on a smaller population, this uncertainty should be taken into account, otherwise SEs may be too small, particularly for marginal values, and, therefore, confidence intervals too narrow.},

  abstract        = {This study introduces a novel method for estimating the variance of life expectancy since diagnosis (LE (C)) and loss in life expectancy (LLE) for cancer patients within a relative survival framework in situations where life tables based on the entire general population are not accessible. LE (C)and LLE are useful summary measures of survival in population-based cancer studies, but require information on the mortality in the general population. Our method addresses the challenge of incorporating the uncertainty of expected mortality rates when using a sample from the general population. To illustrate the approach, we estimated LE (C)and LLE for patients diagnosed with colon and breast cancer in Sweden. General population mortality rates were based on a random sample drawn from comparators of a matched cohort. Flexible parametric survival models were used to model the mortality among cancer patients and the mortality in the random sample from the general population. Based on the models, LE (C)and LLE together with their variances were estimated. The results were compared with those obtained using fixed expected mortality rates. By accounting for the uncertainty of expected mortality rates, the proposed method ensures more accurate estimates of variances and, therefore, confidence intervals of LE (C)and LLE for cancer patients. This is particularly valuable for older patients and some cancer types, where underestimation of the variance can be substantial when the entire general population data are not accessible. The method can be implemented using existing software, making it accessible for use in various cancer studies. The provided example of Stata code further facilitates its adoption.},

The aim of this study was to examine whether these differences in outcome remain, based on updated information from five national cancer registers. The data used for the analysis was from the NORDCAN database focusing on nine common cancers diagnosed 1990-2016 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden with maximum follow-up through 2017. Relative survival (RS) was estimated at 1 and 5 years using flexible parametric RS models, and percentage point differences between the earliest and latest years available were calculated. A consistent improvement in both 1- and 5-year RS was found for most studied sites across all countries. Previously observed differences between the countries have been attenuated. The improvements were particularly pronounced in Denmark that now has cancer survival similar to the other Nordic countries. The reasons for the observed improvements in cancer survival are likely multifactorial, including earlier diagnosis, improved treatment options, implementation of national cancer plans, uniform national cancer care guidelines and standardized patient pathways. The previous survival disadvantage in Denmark is no longer present for most sites. Continuous monitoring of cancer survival is of importance to assess the impact of changes in policies and the effectiveness of health care systems.},

In general, survival was similar across age and sex. The largest improvement was seen for Danish men and women with rectal cancer, from 41% to 69% and from 43% to 71%, respectively. The age-standardized and reference-adjusted five-year crude probability of death in colon cancer ranged from 30% to 36% across countries, and for rectal cancer from 20% to 33%. The average number of age-standardized and reference-adjusted life-years lost ranged between six and nine years. There were substantial improvements in colon and rectal cancer survival in all Nordic countries 1990-2016.

The aim was to estimate age-specific survival trends over calendar time, including life-years lost, to evaluate if improvements have benefited patients across all ages in the Nordic countries. Data on breast cancers diagnosed 1990-2016 in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden were obtained from the NORDCAN database. Age-standardized and age-specific relative survival (RS) was estimated using flexible parametric models, as was reference-adjusted crude probabilities of death and life-years lost. Age-standardized period estimates of 5-year RS in women diagnosed with breast cancer ranged from 87% to 90% and 10-year RS from 74% to 85%. Ten-year RS increased with 15-18 percentage points from 1990 to 2016, except in Sweden (+9 percentage points) which had the highest survival in 1990. The largest improvements were observed in Denmark, where a previous survival disadvantage diminished. Most recent 5-year crude probabilities of cancer death ranged from 9% (Finland, Sweden) to 12% (Denmark, Iceland), and life-years lost from 3.3 years (Finland) to 4.6 years (Denmark). Although survival improvements were consistent across different ages, women aged ≥70 years had the lowest RS in all countries. Period estimates of 5-year RS were 94-95% in age 55 years and 84-89% in age 75 years, while 10-year RS were 88-91% in age 55 years and 69-84% in age 75 years. Women aged 40 years lost on average 11.0-13.8 years, while women lost 3.8-6.0 years if aged 55 and 1.9-3.5 years if aged 75 years. Survival for Nordic women with breast cancer improved from 1990 to 2016 in all age groups, albeit with larger country variation among older women where survival was also lower. Women over 70 years of age have not had the same survival improvement as women of younger age.},

Flexible parametric relative survival models were fitted, except for Iceland where a non-parametric Pohar-Perme approach was used. A range of survival metrics were estimated by sex, both age-standardised and age-specific. The 5-year relative survival improved in all countries, in both women and men and across age. While the improvement was more pronounced in men, women still had a higher survival at the end of the study period. The survival was generally high, with age-standardised estimates of 5-year relative survival towards the end of the study period ranging from 85% in Icelandic men to 95% in Danish women. The age-standardised and reference-adjusted 5-year crude probability of death due to CMM ranged from 5% in Danish and Swedish women to 13% in Icelandic men. Although survival following CMM was relatively high in the Nordic countries in 1990, continued improvements in survival were observed throughout the study period in both women and men and across age.},

  abstract  = {Health care cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) often uses individual
	patient data (IPD) from multinational randomized controlled trials.
	Although designed to account for between-patient sampling variability
	in the clinical and economic data, standard analytical approaches
	to CEA ignore the presence of between-location variability in the
	study results. This is a restrictive limitation given that countries
	often differ in factors that could affect the results of CEAs, such
	as the availability of health care resources, their unit costs, clinical
	practice, and patient case mix. The authors advocate the use of Bayesian
	bivariate hierarchical modeling to analyze multinational cost-effectiveness
	data. This analytical framework explicitly recognizes that patient-level
	costs and outcomes are nested within countries. Using real-life data,
	the authors illustrate how the proposed methods can be applied to
	obtain (a) more appropriate estimates of overall cost-effectiveness
	and associated measure of sampling uncertainty compared to standard
	CEA and (b) country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates that can
	be used to assess the between-location variability of the study results
	while controlling for differences in country-specific and patient-specific
	characteristics. It is demonstrated that results from standard CEA
	using IPD from multinational trials display a large degree of variability
	across the 17 countries included in the analysis, producing potentially
	misleading results. In contrast, "shrinkage estimates'' obtained
	from the modeling approach proposed here facilitate the appropriate
	quantification of country-specific cost-effectiveness estimates while
	weighting the results based on the level of information available
	within each country. The authors suggest that the methods presented
	here represent a general framework for the analysis of economic data
	collected from different locations.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an experimental infection
	of young adults with a history of episodic and exclusive viral wheeze
	(EVW) using human coronavirus, in which 16 of 24 with EVW (15 atopic)
	and 11 of 19 healthy controls (seven atopic) developed a symptomatic
	cold with evidence of infection, but only those with EVW developed
	lower respiratory tract symptoms and increased airway responsiveness.
	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the EVW and control
	groups from this study for inflammatory changes occurring in the
	upper and lower respiratory tracts during the experimental infection,
	in particular, to determine whether eosinophil-driven inflammation
	was associated with EVW. METHODS: Nasal lavage and induced sputum
	were collected prior to inoculation (day 0) and 2, 4 and 17 days
	later. Differential cell counts were performed and supernatant was
	assayed for IL-8, IL-5, IFN-gamma, and eosinophilic cationic protein
	(ECP). RESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in
	any measurement at baseline. In both groups, during colds the volume
	of nasal secretion increased as did leucocyte counts in both upper
	and lower respiratory tracts. A modest increase in nasal neutrophil
	count was seen in both EVW and control groups with symptomatic colds
	on day 2 (median (quartile) difference from baseline 5.4 (0.0, 11.0)
	and 1.8 (-1.1, 2.2)x10(4)/mL of secretions, respectively). The change
	in nasal neutrophil counts in all subjects correlated with nasal
	symptom scores. A significant relative increase in sputum differential
	neutrophil count was seen on day 4 in the EVW group with a cold but
	not in controls (mean difference (95\% confidence interval) 20.4
	(9.6, 31.1)\% and 3.1 (-8.2, 14.5)\%, respectively, P<0.01); however,
	this increase did not correlate with lower respiratory tract symptom
	scores. IL-8 increased in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts
	in both EVW and control subjects with colds, the largest change being
	seen on day 4 in the sputum of those with EVW (mean difference from
	baseline (95\% confidence interval) 2.5 (0.55-4.46) ng/mL). Only
	modest changes were seen in IFN-gamma and no changes were seen in
	IL-5 or ECP. None of the results was influenced by the atopic status
	of the subjects in either group. CONCLUSIONS: EVW wheeze is characterized
	by neutrophilic inflammation in both the upper and lower respiratory
	tracts without eosinophilia (even in atopic subjects). IL-8 is likely
	to be an important chemokine in this process. Symptoms and airway
	responsiveness were correlated with change in neutrophils.},

	monitored for the development of symptoms, changes in airway physiology
	and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20\% fall

	symptoms than controls (median scores (interquartile range): 24 (10-37)
	and 6 (4-15), respectively p = 0.014). Sixteen viral wheezers and

	of breath). The viral wheezers with colds had small (3-4\%) reductions
	in FEV1 and peak expiratory flow on days with LRT symptoms (days
	3-6), but a progressive reduction in PC20 from baseline on days 2,
	4 and 17 after inoculation (by 0.82, 1.35 and 1.82 doubling concentrations,

This approach is widely believed to be problematic due to the nonlinearity of some exposure-effect measures. When the expected value of the outcome is modeled as a nonlinear function of the exposure, the adjusted and unadjusted exposure effects can differ even in the absence of confounding (Greenland , Robins, and Pearl, 1999); we call this the nonlinearity effect. In this paper, we propose a corrected measure of confounding that does not include the nonlinearity effect. The performances of the simple and corrected estimates of confounding are assessed in simulations and illustrated using a study of risk factors for low birth-weight infants. We conclude that the simple estimate of confounding is adequate or even preferred in settings where the nonlinearity effect is very small. In settings with a sizable nonlinearity effect, the corrected estimate of confounding has improved performance.}}

	and 2004 in England, Norway and Sweden were included in this population-based
	study of patients with colorectal cancer. The main outcome measures
	were 5-year cumulative relative period of survival and excess death
	rates stratified by age and period of follow-up.The survival of English
	patients with colorectal cancer was significantly lower than was
	observed in both Norway and Sweden. Five-year age-standardised colon
	cancer relative survival was 51.1\% (95\% CI 50.1\% to 52.0\%) in
	England compared with 57.9\% (95\% CI 55.2\% to 60.5\%) in Norway
	and 59.9\% (95\% CI 57.7\% to 62.0\%) in Sweden. Five-year rectal

	compared with 60.7\% (95\% CI 57.0\% to 64.2\%) and 59.8\% (95\%
	CI 56.9\% to 62.6\%) in Norway and Sweden, respectively. The lower
	survival for colon cancer in England was primarily due to a high
	number of excess deaths among older patients in the first 3 months
	after diagnosis. In patients with rectal cancer, excess deaths remained
	elevated until 2 years of follow-up. If the lower excess death rate
	in Norway applied in the English population, then 890 (13.6\%) and
	654 (16.8\%) of the excess deaths in the colon and rectal cancer
	populations, respectively, could have been prevented at 5 years follow-up.
	Most of these avoidable deaths occurred shortly after diagnosis.There
	was significant variation in survival between the countries, with
	the English population experiencing a poorer outcome, primarily due
	to a relatively higher number of excess deaths in older patients
	in the short term after diagnosis. It seems likely, therefore, that

	rapidly fatal disease (especially in the older age groups) than in

"InterPreT Cancer Survival" is a newly developed, publicly available, online interactive cancer survival tool targeted towards health-care professionals and epidemiologists (http://interpret.le.ac.uk). It focuses on the correct interpretation of commonly reported cancer survival measures facilitated through the use of dynamic interactive graphics. Statistics presented are based on parameter estimates obtained from flexible parametric relative survival models using large population-based English registry data containing information on survival across 6 cancer sites; Breast, Colon, Rectum, Stomach, Melanoma and Lung. Through interactivity, the tool improves understanding of various measures and how survival or mortality may vary by age and sex. Routine measures of cancer survival are reported, however, individualised estimates using crude probabilities are advocated, which is more appropriate for patients or health care professionals. The results are presented in various interactive formats facilitating understanding of individual risk and differences between various measures. "InterPreT Cancer Survival" is presented as an educational tool which engages the user through interactive features to improve the understanding of commonly reported cancer survival statistics. The tool has received positive feedback from a Cancer Research UK patient sounding board and there are further plans to incorporate more disease characteristics, e.g. stage.},

This study investigates the impact of different DOI rules on cancer survival estimates. Detailed data on dates of pathological confirmation and hospital admittance were collected from three registries participating in the ICBP SURVMARK-2 project (England, Northern Ireland and Norway). Multiple dates of incidence were determined for each cancer patient diagnosed during 2010-2014 by applying three sets of rules that prioritize either: a) histological date, b) hospital admittance date or c) the earliest date recorded. For each set of rules and registry, 1- and 5-year net survival were estimated for eight cancer sites (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, lung and ovary). The mean difference between different DOIs within a country and cancer site ranged from 0.1-23 days. The variation in 1- and 5-year net survival using different DOIs were generally small for all registries and cancer sites. Only for liver and pancreatic cancer in Norway and ovarian cancer in England, were larger 1-year survival differences, of 2-3 % found. In the ongoing discussion of the comparability of survival estimates across registry populations, the use of different DOI definitions can be considered to have a very limited impact.},

A range of different survival measures exist, each serving different purposes and targeting different audiences. It is important that routine publications expand on current practice and provide estimates on a wider range of survival measures. We examine the feasibility of automated production of such statistics. We used data on 23 cancer sites obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN). We propose an automated way of estimating flexible parametric relative survival models and calculating estimates of net survival, crude probabilities, and loss in life expectancy across many cancer sites and subgroups of patients. For 21 of 23 cancer sites, we were able to estimate survival models without assuming proportional hazards. Reliable estimates of all desired measures were obtained for all cancer sites. It may be challenging to implement new survival measures in routine publications as it can require the application of modeling techniques. We propose a way of automating the production of such statistics and show that we can obtain reliable estimates across a range of measures and subgroups of patients.},

	between socioeconomic groups in England, with particular attention
	to survival in the short term of follow-up.Individuals diagnosed
	with colorectal cancer between 1996 and 2004 in England were identified
	from cancer registry records. Five-year cumulative relative survival
	and excess death rates were computed.For colon cancer there was a
	very high excess death rate in the first month of follow-up, and
	the excess death rate was highest in the socioeconomically deprived
	groups. In subsequent periods, excess mortality rates were much lower
	and there was less socioeconomic variation. The pattern of variation
	in excess death rates was generally similar in rectal cancer but
	the socioeconomic difference in death rates persisted several years
	longer. If the excess death rates in the entire colorectal cancer
	patient population were the same as those observed in the most affluent
	socioeconomic quintile, the annual reduction would be 360 deaths
	in colon cancer and 336 deaths in rectal cancer patients. These deaths
	occurred almost entirely in the first month and the first year after
	diagnosis.Recent developments in the national cancer control agenda
	have included an increasing emphasis on outcome measures, with short-term
	cancer survival an operational measure of variation and progress
	in cancer control. In providing clues to the nature of the survival
	differences between socioeconomic groups, the results presented here
	give strong support for this strategy.},

	findings from relative survival with those obtained using Cox proportional
	and non-proportional hazards models in standard all-cause survival.
	Estimated survival rates are higher using relative survival models

	children aged between 1 and 5 years (preschool viral wheeze). Most
	affected children are asymptomatic by age 6 years. Persistence of
	wheeze is associated with above-average systemic eosinophil priming.
	Use of parental-initiated oral prednisolone is recommended at the
	first sign of preschool viral wheeze. However, evidence for this
	treatment strategy is conflicting. We therefore aimed to assess the
	efficacy of a short course of oral prednisolone for preschool viral
	wheeze, with stratification for systemic eosinophil priming. METHODS:
	Children aged 1-5 years admitted to hospital with viral wheeze were
	allocated to either a high-primed or low-primed stratum according
	to amounts of serum eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil protein
	X, and randomised to parent-initiated prednisolone (20 mg one daily
	for 5 days) or placebo for the next episode. The primary outcomes
	were the 7-day mean daytime and night-time respiratory symptom scores,
	which were analysed by mean differences between treatment groups.
	FINDINGS: 108 children were randomised to placebo and 109 to prednisolone.
	Outcome data were available for 120 (78\%) of 153 children who had
	a further episode of viral wheeze, of whom 51 received prednisolone
	and 69 placebo. Mean daytime (difference in means -0.01 [-0.22 to
	0.20]) and night-time (0.10 [-0.12 to 0.32]) respiratory symptom
	scores and need for hospital admission did not differ between treatment
	groups. Within the high-primed (n=59) and low-primed (n=61) strata
	there was no difference in primary outcome between treatment groups.
	INTERPRETATION: There is no clear benefit of a short course of parent-initiated
	oral prednisolone for viral wheeze in children aged 1-5 years even
	in those with above-average eosinophil priming.},

	STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, observational study was carried out
	in two large teaching hospitals. Three hundred and forty-eight women
	with a confirmed clinic blood pressure of at least 140/90 mm Hg were
	recruited. Conventional blood pressure measurements (< or =5) were
	obtained on the day unit and simultaneously an ambulatory blood pressure

	assessment (blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg) and automated blood pressure
	monitoring (blood pressure > 130/85 mm Hg) was compared. Principal
	outcome measures included the occurrence of severe hypertension (>
	160/110 mm Hg) and proteinuria (> 500 mg or 2+) within (a) 2 weeks
	and (b) the remainder of the pregnancy. Thompson's method was used
	to compare sensitivity and specificity of the day unit blood pressure
	and automated blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: Three hundred and
	forty-eight women were recruited to the study. The comparison between
	automated blood pressure monitoring and conventional blood pressure
	measurement for both sensitivity and specificity for systolic and
	diastolic blood pressure revealed increased sensitivity and decreased
	specificity with automated blood pressure monitoring for all principal

	Sensitivity for the outcomes was increased with automated blood pressure
	monitoring by between 14\% and 27\% for systolic blood pressure and

We followed 4,529,460 Swedes from 1987 to 2010 and identified ALS and fractures from the Swedish National Patient Register. We examined associations of ALS risk with all fractures, osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic fractures, and traumatic and non-traumatic fractures among individuals aged 30-80 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed the association of ALS with time since fracture using a Poisson regression model. All fractures (HR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.39-1.65) as well as osteoporotic (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.41-1.79), non-osteoporotic (HR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.31-1.63), traumatic (HR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.37-1.63), and non-traumatic (HR: 1.80, 95% CI 1.35-2.40) fractures were associated with a higher incidence of ALS. Increased ALS incidence was associated with fractures occurring from one (HR: 2.33, 95% CI 2.04-2.66) to 18 (HR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.43) years before ALS diagnosis.

Using flexible parametric survival modelling, the loss in working years was calculated as the difference in the remaining years in the work force between women with and without breast cancer. Women aged 50 years at diagnosis with stage I disease lost on average 0.5 years (95% CI, 0.2-0.7) of their remaining working time; the corresponding estimates were 0.9 years (0.5-1.2) in stage II, 2.5 years (1.9-3.1) in stage III and 8.1 years (6.5-9.7) in stage IV. Women with in situ breast cancer did not lose any working years. The strongest treatment determinant was axillary lymph node dissection. We found a loss in working years not only in late but also in early-stage breast cancer. Although it is reassuring that some groups had no or only a modest work loss, the economic consequences for society are considerable given the large number of women annually diagnosed with breast cancer.},

	gave very high type 1 (false-positive) error rates, up to 49\%, in
	the presence of high levels of inter-centre variation and turnover.
	Of the other methods investigated, logistic regression with random
	effects for centre performed best: it had appropriate error rates
	for all study designs assessed and generally had higher power than
	fixed-effects or cluster-robust approaches. A 'Diffuse' study with
	more centres contributing fewer isolates was less susceptible to
	the ill-effects of inter-centre variation than a study of equal overall
	size with fewer centres contributing more, and had slightly higher
	power. CONCLUSIONS: Unadjusted logistic regression, ignoring inter-centre
	variation, is unsuitable for the analysis of trends in typical resistance
	surveillance studies, often leads to erroneous conclusions and should
	be avoided. Random effects logistic regression is an appropriate,
	widely applicable alternative, available in most standard statistical
	software. Collecting isolates from a larger number of centres has
	both statistical and scientific advantages.},

	a systematic review, and in this situation a separate univariate
	meta-analysis is usually applied to synthesize the evidence for each

	meta-analysis model that utilizes any correlation between outcomes
	and obtains all the pooled estimates jointly. Surprisingly, multivariate
	meta-analysis is rarely considered in practice, so in this paper
	we illustrate the benefits and limitations of the approach to provide
	helpful insight for practitioners.We compare a bivariate random-effects
	meta-analysis (BRMA) to two independent univariate random-effects
	meta-analyses (URMA), and show how and why a BRMA is able to 'borrow
	strength' across outcomes. Then, on application to two examples in
	healthcare, we show: (i) given complete data for both outcomes in
	each study, BRMA is likely to produce individual pooled estimates
	with very similar standard errors to those from URMA; (ii) given
	some studies where one of the outcomes is missing at random, the
	'borrowing of strength' is likely to allow BRMA to produce individual
	pooled estimates with noticeably smaller standard errors than those
	from URMA; (iii) for either complete data or missing data, BRMA will
	produce a more appropriate standard error of the pooled difference
	between outcomes as it incorporates their correlation, which is not
	possible using URMA; and (iv) despite its advantages, BRMA may often
	not be possible due to the difficulty in obtaining the within-study
	correlations required to fit the model. Bivariate meta-regression

	patients with different risks of outcome (e.g. recurrence of disease),
	and are important tools in the management of cancer and many other
	diseases. Systematic review and meta-analytical approaches to identifying
	the most valuable prognostic markers are needed because (sometimes
	conflicting) evidence relating to markers is often published across
	a number of studies. To investigate the practicality of this approach,
	an empirical investigation of a systematic review of tumour markers
	for neuroblastoma was performed; 260 studies of prognostic markers
	were identified, which considered 130 different markers. The reporting
	of these studies was often inadequate, in terms of both statistical
	analysis and presentation, and there was considerable heterogeneity
	for many important clinical/statistical factors. These problems restricted
	both the extraction of data and the meta-analysis of results from
	the primary studies, limiting feasibility of the evidence-based approach.Guidelines
	for reporting the results of primary prognostic marker studies in
	cancer, and other diseases, are given in order to facilitate both
	the interpretation of individual studies and the undertaking of systematic
	reviews, meta-analysis and, ultimately, evidence-based practice.
	General availability of full individual patient data is a necessary
	step forward and would overcome the majority of problems encountered,
	including poorly reported summary statistics and variability in cutoff
	level, outcome assessed and adjustment factors used. It would also
	limit the problem of reporting bias, although publication bias will
	remain a concern until studies are prospectively registered. Such

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: When multiple endpoints are of interest in evidence synthesis,
	a multivariate meta-analysis can jointly synthesise those endpoints
	and utilise their correlation. A multivariate random-effects meta-analysis
	must incorporate and estimate the between-study correlation (rhoB).
	METHODS: In this paper we assess maximum likelihood estimation of
	a general normal model and a generalised model for bivariate random-effects
	meta-analysis (BRMA). We consider two applied examples, one involving
	a diagnostic marker and the other a surrogate outcome. These motivate
	a simulation study where estimation properties from BRMA are compared
	with those from two separate univariate random-effects meta-analyses
	(URMAs), the traditional approach. RESULTS: The normal BRMA model
	estimates rhoB as -1 in both applied examples. Analytically we show
	this is due to the maximum likelihood estimator sensibly truncating
	the between-study covariance matrix on the boundary of its parameter
	space. Our simulations reveal this commonly occurs when the number
	of studies is small or the within-study variation is relatively large;
	it also causes upwardly biased between-study variance estimates,
	which are inflated to compensate for the restriction on rhoB. Importantly,
	this does not induce any systematic bias in the pooled estimates
	and produces conservative standard errors and mean-square errors.
	Furthermore, the normal BRMA is preferable to two normal URMAs; the
	mean-square error and standard error of pooled estimates is generally
	smaller in the BRMA, especially given data missing at random. For
	meta-analysis of proportions we then show that a generalised BRMA
	model is better still. This correctly uses a binomial rather than
	normal distribution, and produces better estimates than the normal
	BRMA and also two generalised URMAs; however the model may sometimes
	not converge due to difficulties estimating rhoB. CONCLUSION: A BRMA
	model offers numerous advantages over separate univariate synthesises;
	this paper highlights some of these benefits in both a normal and
	generalised modelling framework, and examines the estimation of between-study
	correlation to aid practitioners.},

	for synthesizing evidence across clinical studies. However, for some
	studies IPD may not be available and only aggregate data (AD), such
	as a treatment effect estimate and its standard error, may be obtained.
	In this situation, methods for combining IPD and AD are important
	to utilize all the available evidence. In this paper, we develop
	and assess a range of statistical methods for combining IPD and AD
	in meta-analysis of continuous outcomes from randomized controlled
	trials.The methods take either a one-step or a two-step approach.
	The latter is simple, with IPD reduced to AD so that standard AD
	meta-analysis techniques can be employed. The one-step approach is
	more complex but offers a flexible framework to include both patient-level
	and trial-level parameters. It uses a dummy variable to distinguish
	IPD trials from AD trials and to constrain which parameters the AD
	trials estimate. We show that this is important when assessing how
	patient-level covariates modify treatment effect, as aggregate-level
	relationships across trials are subject to ecological bias and confounding.
	We thus develop models to separate within-trial and across-trials
	treatment-covariate interactions; this ensures that only IPD trials
	estimate the former, whilst both IPD and AD trials estimate the latter
	in addition to the pooled treatment effect and any between-study
	heterogeneity. Extension to multiple correlated outcomes is also
	considered. Ten IPD trials in hypertension, with blood pressure the
	continuous outcome of interest, are used to assess the models and
	identify the benefits of utilizing AD alongside IPD.},

	is the unavailability of some estimates from published and unpublished
	studies. Dissemination bias, in how and what outcomes are reported
	or published, may be causing this incompleteness. This article illustrates
	these problems and presents possible sensitivity analyses to allow
	the most reliable conclusions. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a systematic
	review of prognostic marker MYC-N in neuroblastoma, meta-analysis
	for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was of
	interest. Only 17 published studies enabled extraction of both outcome
	estimates, 25 enabled only DFS, 39 enabled only OS, and 70 enabled
	neither outcome. Unidentified unpublished studies may also exist.
	We assessed the robustness of the pooled estimates to the problem
	of missing information. Because OS and DFS estimates seemed to be
	related, we used the known outcome estimates to predict estimates
	known to be missing, and combined this approach with existing methods
	for assessing dissemination bias. RESULTS: The results of the sensitivity
	analyses suggested that the original meta-analysis results were likely
	to be an overestimate of the true OS and DFS effect-sizes but strengthened
	the belief that MYC-N is a potentially important prognostic marker
	in neuroblastoma. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses in meta-analysis
	allow more appropriate and reliable conclusions when problems such

The minimum sample size criteria aim to ensure precise estimation of key measures of a model's predictive performance, including measures of calibration, discrimination, and net benefit. Here, we extend the sample size guidance to prediction models with a time-to-event (survival) outcome, to cover external validation in datasets containing censoring. A simulation-based framework is proposed, which calculates the sample size required to target a particular confidence interval width for the calibration slope measuring the agreement between predicted risks (from the model) and observed risks (derived using pseudo-observations to account for censoring) on the log cumulative hazard scale. Precise estimation of calibration curves, discrimination, and net-benefit can also be checked in this framework. The process requires assumptions about the validation population in terms of the (i) distribution of the model's linear predictor and (ii) event and censoring distributions. Existing information can inform this; in particular, the linear predictor distribution can be approximated using the C-index or Royston's D statistic from the model development article, together with the overall event risk. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to calculate the sample size required to validate a prediction model for recurrent venous thromboembolism. Ideally the sample size should ensure precise calibration across the entire range of predicted risks, but must at least ensure adequate precision in regions important for clinical decision-making.

	and reported by cancer registries. A single figure of relative survival
	is often required to make reporting simpler. This can be obtained
	by pooling all ages or, more commonly, by using age-standardisation.
	The various methods for providing a single figure estimate of relative
	survival can give very different estimates.The problem is illustrated
	through an example using Finnish thyroid cancer data. The differences
	are further explored through a simulation study that investigates
	the effect of age on the estimates of relative survival.The example
	highlights that in practice the all-age estimates from the various
	methods can be substantially different (up to 6 percentage units
	at 15 years of follow-up). The simulation study confirms the finding
	that differing estimates for the all-age estimates of relative survival
	are obtained. Performing age-standardisation makes the methods more
	comparable and results in better estimation of the true net survival.The
	all-age estimates of relative survival rarely give an appropriate
	estimate of net survival. We feel that modelling or stratifying by
	age when calculating relative survival is vitally important as the
	lack of homogeneity in the cohort of patients leads to potentially
	biased estimates. We feel that the methods using modelling provide
	a greater flexibility than life-table based approaches. The flexible
	parametric approach does not require an arbitrary splitting of the
	time-scale, which makes it more computationally efficient. It also
	has the advantage of easily being extended to incorporate time-dependent

We further de;1;scribe how the pre-weighting approach to age-standardization can be coupled with the Pohar Perme estimator in both a cohort and period analysis setting. For period analysis, we compare approaches for defining the internal age distribution. We use SEER public use data to illustrate our approach and estimate survival for Connecticut and by race to create a scenario with sufficient sparsity. The pre-weighting approach gives comparable estimates to traditional age-standardization in cases with sufficient data and produces estimates throughout follow-up in cases of sparsity when a traditional approach would fail. International comparison studies and other national population-based survival studies that need to age-standardize estimates for comparability purposes should adopt the Pohar Perme estimator with pre-weighting. This approach avoids issues of non-estimation in the case of sparsity and will allow more consistent comparisons across the produced estimates.},

  abstract        = {Ensuring fair comparisons of cancer survival statistics across population groups requires careful consideration of differential competing mortality due to other causes, and adjusting for imbalances over groups in other prognostic covariates (e.g. age). This has typically been achieved using comparisons of age-standardised net survival, with age standardisation addressing covariate imbalance, and the net estimates removing differences in competing mortality from other causes. However, these estimates lack ease of interpretability. In this paper, we motivate an alternative non-parametric approach that uses a common rate of other cause mortality across groups to give reference-adjusted estimates of the all-cause and cause-specific crude probability of death in contrast to solely reporting net survival estimates. We develop the methodology for a non-parametric equivalent of standardised and reference adjusted crude probabilities of death, building on the estimation of non-parametric crude probabilities of death. We illustrate the approach using regional comparisons of survival following a diagnosis of rectal cancer for men in England. We standardise to the covariate distribution and other cause mortality of England as a whole to offer comparability, but with close approximation to the observed all-cause region-specific mortality. The approach gives comparable estimates to observed crude probabilities of death, but allows direct comparison across population groups with different covariate profiles and competing mortality patterns. In our illustrative example, we show that regional variations in survival following a diagnosis of rectal cancer persist even after accounting for the variation in deprivation, age at diagnosis and other cause mortality. The methodological approach of using standardised and reference adjusted metrics offers an appealing approach for future cancer survival comparison studies and routinely published cancer statistics. Our non-parametric estimation approach through the use of weighting offers the ability to estimate comparable survival estimates without the need for statistical modelling.},

Rates may additionally be affected by selection bias caused by the requirement that a cohort have a minimum lookback window, i.e. observation time prior to start of at-risk follow-up. Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated incorporating published population reference rates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), using Poisson regression with rates in CPRD GOLD contrasted to ONS rates, stratified by age, calendar year and sex. An overall SMR was estimated along with SMRs presented for cohorts with different lookback windows (1, 2, 5, 10 years). SMRs were stratified by calendar year, length of follow-up and age group. Mortality rates in a random sample of 1 million CPRD GOLD patients were slightly lower than the national population [SMR = 0.980 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.973, 0.987)]. Cohorts with observational lookback had SMRs below one [1 year of lookback; SMR = 0.905 (0.898, 0.912), 2 years; SMR = 0.881 (0.874, 0.888), 5 years; SMR = 0.849 (0.841, 0.857), 10 years; SMR = 0.837 (0.827, 0.847)]. Mortality rates in the first two years after patient entry into CPRD were higher than the general population, while SMRs dropped below one thereafter. Mortality rates in CPRD, using simple entry requirements, are similar to rates seen in the English population. The requirement of at least a single year of lookback results in lower mortality rates compared to national estimates.},

	England. This population-based study estimated the 5-year relative
	survival and 'cure' for 48ÃÂÃÂ 380 adult patients diagnosed with AML
	in England during 1971-2006. Relative survival and cure mixture models
	were used to produce estimates of 5-year relative survival and the
	percentage 'cured'. 'Cure' was defined as the proportion of a group
	of survivors for whom there is no excess mortality compared with
	the general population. The 5-year relative survival and the percentage
	'cured' increased for patients aged under 70ÃÂÃÂ years at diagnosis during
	1971-2006, but advancing age was associated with poorer outcome.
	During the study period a dramatic increase in 5-year relative survival
	occurred in those aged 15-24ÃÂÃÂ years, from 7\% to 53\%. The percentage
	'cured' was less than 10\% for all ages in 1975, but increased to
	45\% for those aged 15-24ÃÂÃÂ years in 2000. Cure could not be estimated
	for patients over 70ÃÂÃÂ years, because survival was consistently low
	(<5\%). The long-term outcome of patients with AML has improved substantially,
	particularly in younger patients. The potential exists for further
	increasing levels of 'cure'.},

In a multi-state setting, there are various measures to be estimated that are of great epidemiological importance. However, increased complexity of the multi-state setting and predictions over time for individuals with different covariate patterns may lead to increased difficulty in communicating the estimated measures. The need for easy and meaningful communication of the analysis results motivated the development of a web tool to address these issues. MSMplus is a publicly available web tool, developed via the Shiny R package, with the aim of enhancing the understanding of multi-state model analyses results. The results from any multi-state model analysis are uploaded to the application in a pre-specified format. Through a variety of user-tailored interactive graphs, the application contributes to an improvement in communication, reporting and interpretation of multi-state analysis results as well as comparison between different approaches. The predicted measures that can be supported by MSMplus include, among others, the transition probabilities, the transition intensity rates, the length of stay in each state, the probability of ever visiting a state and user defined measures. Representation of differences, ratios and confidence intervals of the aforementioned measures are also supported. MSMplus is a useful tool that enhances communication and understanding of multi-state model analyses results. Further use and development of web tools should be encouraged in the future as a means to communicate scientific research.},

Depending on the research question of interest and the information contained in the data, different multi-state structures and modelling choices can be applied. We aim to explore different research questions using a series of multi-state models of increasing complexity when studying repeated prescriptions data, while also evaluating different modelling choices. We develop a series of research questions regarding the probability of being under antidepressant medication across time using multi-state models, among Swedish women diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 18,313) and an age-matched population comparison group of cancer-free women (n = 92,454) using a register-based database (Breast Cancer Data Base Sweden 2.0). Research questions were formulated ranging from simple to more composite ones. Depending on the research question, multi-state models were built with structures ranging from simpler ones, like single-event survival analysis and competing risks, up to complex bidirectional and recurrent multi-state structures that take into account the recurring start and stop of medication. We also investigate modelling choices, such as choosing a time-scale for the transition rates and borrowing information across transitions. Each structure has its own utility and answers a specific research question. However, the more complex structures (bidirectional, recurrent) enable accounting for the intermittent nature of prescribed medication data. These structures deliver estimates of the probability of being under medication and total time spent under medication over the follow-up period. Sensitivity analyses over different definitions of the medication cycle and different choices of timescale when modelling the transition intensity rates show that the estimates of total probabilities of being in a medication cycle over follow-up derived from the complex structures are quite stable. Each research question requires the definition of an appropriate multi-state structure, with more composite ones requiring such an increase in the complexity of the multi-state structure. When a research question is related with an outcome of interest that repeatedly changes over time, such as the medication status based on prescribed medication, the use of novel multi-state models of adequate complexity coupled with sensible modelling choices can successfully address composite, more realistic research questions.},

	of long-term survival. Period analysis, based on life-table methodology,
	provides more up-to-date survival estimates by exploring survival
	during a restricted recent period of interest. It excludes the short-term
	survival of patients recruited at the start of the study. We use
	statistical models to further develop the method of period analysis,
	providing more up-to-date estimates of survival and the ability to
	explore differences in survival by covariates and adjust for case
	mix. METHODS: We use cancer registry data for colorectal cancer in
	Leicestershire, UK, to illustrate the use of Cox proportional hazards
	(CPH) models to estimate period and standard survival. We compare
	these estimates with those obtained using life-table methodology.
	RESULTS: Period estimates were slightly higher than the standard
	estimates as they reflect recent improvements in short-term survival.
	The results for period analysis using the life-table approach and
	using CPH models were similar. However, CPH models allowed further
	investigation of other risk factors and the ability to control for
	potential confounding variables. CONCLUSION: Using period survival
	estimates, more up-to-date information is available to clinicians
	and others with an interest in monitoring survival. Period CHP models
	offer all the advantages of statistical modeling, and are straightforward
	to fit in standard statistical packages.},

Period analysis was used for better predictions for newly diagnosed patients, and missing-stage information was imputed for 9918 patients. Female relative survival was assigned to male subjects to demonstrate the survival discrepancies experienced between sexes. At the age of 60, males diagnosed at the regional stage lose an average of 4.99 years of life compared to the general population, and females lose 4.79 years, demonstrating the sex variation in expected mortality. In 2017, males contributed 3545 more life years lost than females, and a potential 1931 life years could be preserved if sex differences in survival were eliminated. This study demonstrates the survival differences across population subgroups as a result of a melanoma cancer diagnosis. Females experience better prognosis across age and stage at diagnosis; however, further investigation is necessary to better understand the mechanisms behind this difference.},

Information governance restrictions inhibit the active dissemination of individual level data to accompany published manuscripts. Realistic, high-fidelity time-to-event synthetic data can aid in the acceleration of methodological developments in survival analysis and beyond by enabling researchers to access and test published methods using data similar to that which they were developed on. We present methods to accurately emulate the covariate patterns and survival times found in real-world datasets using synthetic data techniques, without compromising patient privacy. We model the joint covariate distribution of the original data using covariate specific sequential conditional regression models, then fit a complex flexible parametric survival model from which to generate survival times conditional on individual covariate patterns. We recreate the administrative censoring mechanism using the last observed follow-up date information from the initial dataset. Metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the synthetic data, and the non-identifiability of individuals from the original dataset, are presented. We successfully create a synthetic version of an example colon cancer dataset consisting of 9064 patients which aims to show good similarity to both covariate distributions and survival times from the original data, without containing any exact information from the original data, therefore allowing them to be published openly alongside research. We evaluate the effectiveness of the methods for constructing synthetic data, as well as providing evidence that there is minimal risk that a given patient from the original data could be identified from their individual unique patient information. Synthetic datasets using this methodology could be made available alongside published research without breaching data privacy protocols, and allow for data and code to be made available alongside methodological or applied manuscripts to greatly improve the transparency and accessibility of medical research.},

	at 30 days and 1 year. Patients were classified according to antecedent

	1, <7mmol/L; quartile 2, 7 - 8.2 mmol/L; quartile 3, 8.3 - 10.9 mmol/L;
	quartile 4, >/=11 mmol/L). Multivariable models were constructed
	for determinants of mortality, including year of STEMI and demographic
	variables, entering blood glucose concentration and antecedent diabetes
	individually, and together. All-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality
	were 22.8\% and 31.3\% for patients with antecedent diabetes, compared
	to 16.3\% and 23.0\% respectively for those without. For glucose
	quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, crude 30-day mortality was 9.0\%, 10.6\%,
	17.9\% and 31.0\%. Adjusted 30-day mortality risk was similar in
	quartile 2, higher by >80\% in quartile 3 and by >150\% in quartile
	4, compared to glucose quartile 1. Antecedent diabetes was associated
	with an increase in mortality (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.52 (95\%
	CI 1.24 , 1.86)). On multivariable analysis (excluding glucose quartile),
	this reduced to 1.24 (0.98 , 1.58) and changed to a small, statistically
	non-significant reduction in risk when glucose quartile was added
	to the analysis (adjusted OR 0.87 (0.67 , 1.13)). Inclusion of antecedent
	diabetes in multivariable models did not add to the predictive value
	for mortality of glucose quartile (p=0.368). Similar relationships
	were observed for 1 year mortality. In patients with STEMI, blood
	glucose concentration shows graded association with risk of 30-day
	and 1-year mortality and is of greater prognostic relevance than
	antecedent diabetes diagnosis. Moderate elevation of blood glucose,
	below levels previously considered to be clinically relevant, is
	associated with adverse impact on survival.},

  abstract        = {Completeness of recording for cancer stage at diagnosis is often historically poor in cancer registries, making it challenging to provide long-term stage-specific survival estimates. Stage-specific survival differences are driven by differences in short-term prognosis, meaning estimated survival metrics using period analysis are unlikely to be sensitive to imputed historical stage data. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for lung, colon and breast cancer. To represent missing data patterns in less complete registry data, we artificially inflated the proportion of missing stage information conditional on stage at diagnosis and calendar year of diagnosis. Period analysis was applied and missing stage at diagnosis information was imputed under four different conditions to emulate extreme imputed stage distributions. We fit a flexible parametric model for each cancer stage on the excess hazard scale and the differences in stage-specific marginal relative survival were assessed. Estimates were also obtained from non-parametric approaches for validation. There was little difference between the 10-year stage-specific marginal relative survival estimates, regardless of the assumed historical stage distribution. When conducting a period analysis, multiple imputation can be used to obtain stage-specific long-term estimates of relative survival, even when the historical stage information is largely incomplete.},

	METHODS: Glasziou and Irwig have outlined the concept of net clinical
	treatment benefit for identifying the patients for whom the potential
	benefits of treatment outweigh the possible side effects. This study
	revisits the decision whether to use warfarin to treat atrial fibrillation.
	In this analysis, RCT and various sorts of observational data are
	synthesized. RESULTS: This reanalysis brings into question the conclusions
	of the original analysis on who would benefit from warfarin; however,
	caution is advised, due to limitations in the quality of life data
	available. CONCLUSION: A fully realized Bayesian implementation of

	methods for pooling odds ratios when applied to sparse event data
	with emphasis on the use of continuity corrections. BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis
	of side effects from RCTs or risk factors for rare diseases in epidemiological
	studies frequently requires the synthesis of data with sparse event
	rates. Combining such data can be problematic when zero events exist
	in one or both arms of a study as continuity corrections are often
	needed, but, these can influence results and conclusions. METHODS:
	A simulation study was undertaken comparing several meta-analysis
	methods for combining odds ratios (using various classical and Bayesian
	methods of estimation) on sparse event data. Where required, the
	routine use of a constant and two alternative continuity corrections;
	one based on a function of the reciprocal of the opposite group arm
	size; and the other an empirical estimate of the pooled effect size
	from the remaining studies in the meta-analysis, were also compared.
	A number of meta-analysis scenarios were simulated and replicated
	1000 times, varying the ratio of the study arm sizes. RESULTS: Mantel-Haenszel
	summary estimates using the alternative continuity correction factors
	gave the least biased results for all group size imbalances. Logistic
	regression was virtually unbiased for all scenarios and gave good
	coverage properties. The Peto method provided unbiased results for
	balanced treatment groups but bias increased with the ratio of the
	study arm sizes. The Bayesian fixed effect model provided good coverage
	for all group size imbalances. The two alternative continuity corrections
	outperformed the constant correction factor in nearly all situations.
	The inverse variance method performed consistently badly, irrespective
	of the continuity correction used. CONCLUSIONS: Many routinely used
	summary methods provide widely ranging estimates when applied to
	sparse data with high imbalance between the size of the studies'
	arms. A sensitivity analysis using several methods and continuity
	correction factors is advocated for routine practice.},

  abstract        = {Different parametric survival models can lead to widely discordant extrapolations and decision uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analyses. The use of excess hazard (EH) methods, which incorporate general population mortality data, has the potential to reduce model uncertainty. This review highlights key practical considerations of EH methods for estimating long-term survival. Demonstration of methods used a case study of 686 patients from the German Breast Cancer Study Group, followed for a maximum of 7.3 y and divided into low (1/2) and high (3) grade cancers. Seven standard parametric survival models were fit to each group separately. The same 7 distributions were then used in an EH framework, which incorporated general population mortality rates, and fitted both with and without a cure parameter. Survival extrapolations, restricted mean survival time (RMST), and difference in RMST between high and low grades were compared up to 30 years along with Akaike information criterion goodness-of-fit and cure fraction estimates. The sensitivity of the EH models to lifetable misspecification was investigated. In our case study, variability in survival extrapolations was extensive across the standard models, with 30-y RMST ranging from 7.5 to 14.3 y. Incorporation of general population mortality rates using EH cure methods substantially reduced model uncertainty, whereas EH models without cure had less of an effect. Long-term treatment effects approached the null for most models but at varying rates. Lifetable misspecification had minimal effect on RMST differences. EH methods may be useful for survival extrapolation, and in cancer, EHs may decrease over time and be easier to extrapolate than all-cause hazards. EH cure models may be helpful when cure is plausible and likely to result in less extrapolation variability. In health economic modeling, to help anchor long-term survival extrapolation, it has been recommended that survival models incorporate background mortality rates using excess hazard (EH) methods.We present a thorough description of EH methods with and without the assumption of cure and demonstrate user-friendly software to aid researchers wishing to use these methods.EH models are applied to a case study, and we demonstrate that EHs are easier to extrapolate and that the use of the EH cure model, when cure is plausible, can reduce extrapolation variability.EH methods are relatively robust to lifetable misspecification.},

These are preferred as a wide range of hazard shapes can be captured using splines to model the log-cumulative hazard function and can include time-dependent effects for more flexibility. An important issue is the number of knots used for splines. The reliability of estimates are assessed using English data for 10 cancer types and the use of online interactive graphs to enable a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis at the control of the user is demonstrated. Sixty FPMs were fitted to each cancer type with varying degrees of freedom to model the baseline excess hazard and the main and time-dependent effect of age. For each model, we obtained age-specific, age-group and internally age-standardised relative survival estimates. The Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion were also calculated and comparative estimates were obtained using the Ederer II and Pohar Perme methods. Web-based interactive graphs were developed to present results. Age-standardised estimates were very insensitive to the exact number of knots for the splines. Age-group survival is also stable with negligible differences between models. Age-specific estimates are less stable especially for the youngest and oldest patients, of whom there are very few, but for most scenarios perform well. Although estimates do not depend heavily on the number of knots, too few knots should be avoided, as they can result in a poor fit. Interactive graphs engage researchers in assessing model sensitivity to a wide range of scenarios and their use is highly encouraged.},

Relative survival is a commonly used measure in cancer studies that circumvents problems caused by the inaccuracy of the cause of death information. A summary of the prognosis of the cancer population and potential differences between subgroups can be obtained using marginal estimates of relative survival. We utilize regression standardization to obtain marginal estimates of interest in a relative survival framework. Such measures include the standardized relative survival, standardized all-cause survival and standardized crude probabilities of death. Contrasts of these can be formed to explore differences between exposure groups and under certain assumptions are interpreted as causal effects. The difference in standardized all-cause survival can also provide an estimate for the impact of eliminating cancer-related differences between exposure groups. The potential avoidable deaths after such hypothetical scenarios can also be estimated. To illustrate the methods we use the example of survival differences across socio-economic groups for colon cancer. Using relative survival, a range of marginal measures and contrasts were estimated. For these measures we either focused on cancer-related differences only or chose to incorporate both cancer and other cause differences. The impact of eliminating differences between groups was also estimated. Another useful way for quantifying that impact is the avoidable deaths under hypothetical scenarios. Marginal estimates within the relative survival framework provide useful summary measures and can be applied to better understand differences across exposure groups.},

Such applications include investigating the determinants that drive differences in cancer survival across subgroups.

Relative survival, a commonly used measure in cancer epidemiology, can be used to focus on cancer-related differences. We extended mediation analysis to the relative survival framework for exploring cancer inequalities. The marginal effects were obtained using regression standardization, after fitting a relative survival model. Contrasts of interests included both marginal relative survival and marginal all-cause survival differences between exposure groups. Such contrasts include the indirect effect due to a mediator that is identifiable under certain assumptions. A separate model was fitted for the mediator and uncertainty was estimated using parametric bootstrapping. The avoidable deaths under interventions can also be estimated to quantify the impact of eliminating differences. The methods are illustrated using data for individuals diagnosed with colon cancer. Mediation analysis within relative survival allows focus on factors that account for cancer-related differences instead of all-cause differences and helps improve our understanding on cancer inequalities.},

  abstract        = {A commonly reported measure when interested in the survival of cancer patients is relative survival. Relative survival circumvents issues with inaccurate cause of death information by incorporating the expected mortality rates of cancer individuals from population lifetables of the general population. A summary of the cancer population prognosis can be obtained using the marginal relative survival. To explore differences between exposure groups, such as socioeconomic groups, the difference in marginal relative survival between exposed and unexposed can be obtained and under assumptions is interpreted as the average causal effect of exposure to survival. In a modeling context, this is usually estimated by applying regression standardization as the average of the individual-specific estimates after fitting a relative survival model. Regression standardization yields an estimator that consistently estimates the causal effect under standard causal inference assumptions and if the relative survival model is correctly specified. We extend inverse probability weighting (IPW) and doubly robust standardization methods in the relative survival framework as additional valuable tools for obtaining average causal effects when correct model specification might not hold for the relative survival model. IPW yields an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect if a correctly specified model has been fitted for the exposure (propensity score) whereas doubly robust standardization requires that at least one of the propensity score model or the relative survival model is correctly specified. An example using data on melanoma is provided and a simulation study is conducted to investigate how sensitive are the methods to model misspecification, including different ways for obtaining standard errors.},

  abstract        = {When interested in a time-to-event outcome, competing events that prevent the occurrence of the event of interest may be present. In the presence of competing events, various estimands have been suggested for defining the causal effect of treatment on the event of interest. Depending on the estimand, the competing events are either accommodated or eliminated, resulting in causal effects with different interpretations. The former approach captures the total effect of treatment on the event of interest while the latter approach captures the direct effect of treatment on the event of interest that is not mediated by the competing event. Separable effects have also been defined for settings where the treatment can be partitioned into two components that affect the event of interest and the competing event through different causal pathways. We outline various causal effects that may be of interest in the presence of competing events, including total, direct and separable effects, and describe how to obtain estimates using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. Regression standardisation is applied by obtaining the average of individual estimates across all individuals in a study population after fitting a survival model. With standsurv several contrasts of interest can be calculated including differences, ratios and other user-defined functions. Confidence intervals can also be obtained using the delta method. Throughout we use an example analysing a publicly available dataset on prostate cancer to allow the reader to replicate the analysis and further explore the different effects of interest. Several causal effects can be defined in the presence of competing events and, under assumptions, estimates of those can be obtained using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. The choice of which causal effect to define should be given careful consideration based on the research question and the audience to which the findings will be communicated.},

In the presence of confounding, regression models are fitted, and results are often summarised as hazard ratios. However, despite their broad use, hazard ratios are frequently misinterpreted as relative risks instead of relative rates. We discuss measures for summarising the analysis from a regression model that overcome some of the limitations associated with hazard ratios. Such measures are the standardised survival probabilities for treated and untreated: survival probabilities if everyone in the population received treatment and if everyone did not. The difference between treatment arms can be calculated to provide a measure for the treatment effect. Using publicly available data on breast cancer, we demonstrated the usefulness of standardised survival probabilities for comparing the experience between treated and untreated after adjusting for confounding. We also showed that additional important research questions can be addressed by standardising among subgroups of the total population. Standardised survival probabilities are a useful way to report the treatment effect while adjusting for confounding and have an informative interpretation in terms of risk.},

We investigated differences in quality of AMI care and survival between patients with and without previous cancer diagnoses. A retrospective cohort study using Virtual Cardio-Oncology Research Initiative data. Patients aged 40+ years hospitalized in England with AMI between January 2010 and March 2018 were assessed, ascertaining previous cancers diagnosed within 15 years. Multivariable regression was used to assess effects of cancer diagnosis, time, stage, and site on international quality indicators and mortality. Of 512 388 patients with AMI (mean age, 69.3 years; 33.5% women), 42 187 (8.2%) had previous cancers. Patients with cancer had significantly lower use of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (mean percentage point decrease [mppd], 2.6% [95% CI, 1.8-3.4]) and lower overall composite care (mppd, 1.2% [95% CI, 0.9-1.6]). Poorer quality indicator attainment was observed in patients with cancer diagnosed in the last year (mppd, 1.4% [95% CI, 1.8-1.0]), with later stage disease (mppd, 2.5% [95% CI, 3.3-1.4]), and with lung cancer (mppd, 2.2% [95% CI, 3.0-1.3]). Twelve-month all-cause survival was 90.5% in noncancer controls and 86.3% in adjusted counterfactual controls. Differences in post-AMI survival were driven by cancer-related deaths. Modeling improving quality indicator attainment to noncancer patient levels showed modest 12-month survival benefits (lung cancer, 0.6%; other cancers, 0.3%). Measures of quality of AMI care are poorer in patients with cancer, with lower use of secondary prevention medications. Findings are primarily driven by differences in age and comorbidities between cancer and noncancer populations and attenuated after adjustment. The largest impact was observed in recent cancer diagnoses (<1 year) and lung cancer. Further investigation will determine whether differences reflect appropriate management according to cancer prognosis or whether opportunities to improve AMI outcomes in patients with cancer exist.},

A potential solution to this is to borrow strength from larger populations from the same source, but this has not formally been investigated. Using data on 451,222 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink on the presence/absence of intellectual disability and type 2 diabetes mellitus, we compared stratified and combined flexible parametric models, and Chiang's methods, for calculating life expectancy. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Delta method, Chiang's adjusted life table approach and bootstrapping. The flexible parametric models allowed calculation of life expectancy by exact age and beyond traditional life expectancy age thresholds. The combined model that fit age interaction effects as a spline term provided less bias and greater statistical precision for small covariate subgroups by borrowing strength from the larger subgroups. However, careful consideration of the distribution of events in the smallest group was needed. Life expectancy is a simple measure to compare health differences between populations. The use of combined flexible parametric methods to calculate life expectancy in small samples has shown promising results by allowing life expectancy to be modelled by exact age, greater statistical precision, less bias and prediction of different covariate patterns without stratification. We recommend further investigation of their application for both policymakers and researchers.},

Outcome measures included observation of CVD prevalence, other comorbidities (evaluated by the Charlson Comorbidity Index) and deprivation (using the Index of Multiple Deprivation) according to tumour site and allocation to Cancer Alliance. Patients were allocated to CVD prevalence tertiles (minimum: <33.3rd percentile; middle: 33.3rd to 66.6th percentile; maximum: >66.6th percentile). In total, 634 240 patients with a potentially curable malignancy were eligible. The total CVD prevalence for all cancer sites varied between 13.4% (CVD n = 2058; 95% confidence interval 12.8, 13.9) and 19.6% (CVD n = 7818; 95% confidence interval 19.2, 20.0) between Cancer Alliances. CVD prevalence showed regional variation both for male (16-26%) and female patients (8-16%) towards higher CVD prevalence in northern Cancer Alliances. Similar variation was observed for social deprivation, with the proportion of cancer patients being identified as most deprived varying between 3.3% and 32.2%, depending on Cancer Alliance. The variation between Cancer Alliance for total comorbidities was much smaller. Social deprivation, CVD and other comorbidities in patients with a potentially curable malignancy in England show significant regional variations, which may partly contribute to differences observed in treatments and outcomes.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between
	maternal ambulatory blood pressure monitor measurements during pregnancy
	and birth weight in a population of women considered to have hypertension
	according to conventional antenatal clinic measurement. STUDY DESIGN:
	A prospective observational study was carried out within the obstetric
	departments of Leicester Royal Infirmary and Queen Charlotte's Hospital.
	A total of 237 women were found to have hypertension (blood pressure
	>/=140/90 mm Hg) without significant proteinuria during examination
	in the antenatal assessment area. Sequential-day unit blood pressure
	recordings and a 24-hour automated ambulatory blood pressure recording
	were performed, and the results were compared with the principal
	outcome measure of birth weight. RESULTS: A significant inverse association
	(gradient, -13.5; 95\% confidence interval -23.4 to -3.6) was found
	between daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure measurement and
	birth weight. An increase of 5 mm Hg in daytime mean diastolic blood
	pressure was associated with a fall in birth weight of 68.5 g. This
	association remained after adjustment for potential confounders that
	included maternal age, maternal weight, smoking status, ethnicity,
	and gestational age at delivery. No such association was found between
	obstetric day unit assessment of blood pressure and birth weight.
	CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between blood pressure
	and birth weight in nonproteinuric hypertensive pregnancies. The
	best predictor of this association is the daytime mean ambulatory
	diastolic blood pressure measurement. This is further evidence that
	maternal blood pressure may be an important confounding and potentially
	genetic variable in the association between birth weight and subsequent
	adult hypertension.},

  abstract     = {Purpose With excellent cure rates for young patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), there is an increasing number of female survivors of HL interested in becoming pregnant. Here, we report childbearing among contemporarily treated HL survivors in comparison with the general population. Material and Methods Using Swedish registers, 449 women (ages 18 to 40 years) diagnosed with HL between 1992 and 2009 and in remission 9 months after diagnosis were identified. Patients were age- and calendar-year-matched to 2,210 population comparators. Rates of first postdiagnosis childbirth were calculated. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were estimated for different follow-up periods using Cox regression. Cumulative probabilities of first childbirth were calculated in the presence of the competing risk of death or relapse. Results Twenty-two percent of relapse-free patients with HL had a child during follow-up, and first childbirth rates increased over time, from 40.2 per 1,000 person-years (1992 to 1997) to 69.7 per 1,000 person-years (2004 to 2009). For comparators, childbirth rates remained stable (70.1 per 1,000 person-years). Patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 had a cumulative probability of childbirth similar to comparators. Three years or more after diagnosis, no differences in childbirth rates were observed between patients and comparators, regardless of stage or treatment. Patients who received six to eight courses of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone had a lower childbirth rate than comparators during the first 3 years (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.94), as did patients who received six to eight courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.65). Conclusion Childbearing potential among female survivors of HL has improved over time, and childbirth rates 3 years after diagnosis in contemporarily treated patients are, in the absence of relapse, similar to those in the general population, regardless of stage and treatment.},

  abstract        = {As cancer patient survival improves, late effects from treatment are becoming the next clinical challenge. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, for example, potentially increase the risk of both morbidity and mortality from second malignancies and cardiovascular disease. To provide clinically relevant population-level measures of late effects, it is of importance to (1) simultaneously estimate the risks of both morbidity and mortality, (2) partition these risks into the component expected in the absence of cancer and the component due to the cancer and its treatment, and (3) incorporate the multiple time scales of attained age, calendar time, and time since diagnosis. Multistate models provide a framework for simultaneously studying morbidity and mortality, but do not solve the problem of partitioning the risks. However, this partitioning can be achieved by applying a relative survival framework, allowing us to directly quantify the excess risk. This article proposes a combination of these two frameworks, providing one approach to address (1) to (3). Using recently developed methods in multistate modeling, we incorporate estimation of excess hazards into a multistate model. Both intermediate and absorbing state risks can be partitioned and different transitions are allowed to have different and/or multiple time scales. We illustrate our approach using data on Hodgkin lymphoma patients and excess risk of diseases of the circulatory system, and provide user-friendly Stata software with accompanying example code.},

We explored if CVD comorbidity explained surgical resection rate variation and the impact on survival if resection rates increased. Cancer registry data consisted of English patients diagnosed with NSCLC from 2012 to 2016. Linked hospital records identified CVD comorbidities. We investigated resection rate variation by geographical region using funnel plots; resection and death rates using time-to-event analysis. We modelled an increased propensity for resection in regions with the lowest resection rates and estimated survival change. Among 57,373 patients with Stage 1-3A NSCLC, resection rates varied considerably between regions. Patients with CVD comorbidity had lower resection rates and higher mortality rates. CVD comorbidity explained only 1.9% of the variation in resection rates. For every 100 CVD comorbid patients, increasing resection in regions with the lowest rates from 24 to 44% would result in 16 more patients resected and alive after 1 year and two fewer deaths overall. Variation in regional resection rate is not explained by CVD comorbidities. Increasing resection in patients with CVD comorbidity to the levels of the highest resecting region would increase 1-year survival.},

  abstract        = {In population-based cancer studies it is common to try to isolate the impact of cancer by estimating net survival. Net survival is defined as the probability of surviving cancer in the absence of any other-causes of death. Net survival can be estimated either in the cause-specific or relative survival framework. Cause-specific survival considers deaths from the cancer as the event of interest. Relative survival incorporates general population expected mortality rates to represent the other-cause mortality rate. Estimation approaches in both frameworks are impacted by the systematic removal of patients from the risk-set, commonly referred to as informative censoring in the cause-specific framework. In the relative survival framework, the Pohar Perme estimator combats the effect of this systematic removal of patients through weighting. When the two frameworks have been compared, informative censoring is rarely accounted for in the cause-specific framework. We investigate the use of weighted cause-specific Kaplan-Meier estimates to overcome the impact of informative censoring and compared approaches to defining weights. Individuals remaining in the risk-set are upweighted using their predicted other-cause survival obtained through various model-based approaches. We also compare weights derived from expected mortality rates. We applied the approaches to US cancer registry data and conducted a simulation study. Using weighted cause-specific estimates provides a better estimate of marginal net survival. The unweighted Kaplan-Meier estimates have a similar bias to the Ederer II method for relative survival. Weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates are unbiased and similar to the Pohar Perme estimator. There was little variation between the several weighting approaches. In comparisons of cause-specific and relative survival, it is important to compare "like-with-like", therefore, a weighted approach should be considered for both frameworks. If researchers are interested in obtaining net measures in a cause-specific framework, then weighting is needed to account for informative censoring.},

This is a hypothetical measure and is interpreted as excluding the possibility of cancer patients dying from other causes. Crude probability of death partitions the all-cause probability of death into deaths from cancer and other causes. The National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service is the single cancer registry for England. In 2006-2015, 1,590,477 malignant tumours were diagnosed for breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma and prostate cancer in adults. We used a relative survival framework, with a period approach, providing estimates for up to 10-year survival. Mortality was partitioned into deaths due to cancer or other causes. Unconditional and conditional (on surviving 1-years and 5-years) crude probability of death were estimated for the five cancers. Elderly patients who survived for a longer period before dying were more likely to die from other causes of death (except for lung cancer). For younger patients, deaths were almost entirely due to the cancer. There are different measures of survival, each with their own strengths and limitations. Careful choices of survival measures are needed for specific scenarios to maximise the understanding of the data.},

	Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Nineteen
	parents of children aged under 6 years were recruited from a cohort
	of parents who had responded to an earlier respiratory symptom survey
	and from one general practice. RESULTS: Parents judged respiratory
	symptoms using a range of cues, including changes in the sound of
	breathing and changes in appearance and behaviour. Experiential resources
	and contextual factors played an important role in parents' judgements.
	Interpretations of questions about respiratory symptoms were varied,
	particularly in relation to the terms "attacks of wheeze" and "shortness
	of breath". Parents' descriptions of wheeze differed from descriptions
	of the sound of wheeze used in some survey questionnaires. Parents
	drew fine distinctions between different "types" of cough and identified
	a distinct "asthma" cough. CONCLUSIONS: Attention needs to be given
	to the complexity of reporting respiratory symptoms in children and
	to the importance of contextual factors in parents' judgements. We
	suggest that questions which require parents to report on children's
	internal feelings or states be avoided. Consideration should be given
	to providing parents with explicit direction on what cues to attend
	to or ignore in reporting symptoms, and to clarifying some questions
	that are currently used in clinical practice and in surveys.},

	assumption was not (e.g., for colon cancer patients older than 75
	years). Greater variability in the estimates was observed when the
	cure assumption was not supported by the data (breast cancer).If
	the data suggest cure is not a reasonable assumption then we advise
	against fitting cure models. In the scenarios where cure was reasonable,

               prospective observational study of hypertensive pregnancies
               referred for further assessment after in a UK University
               hospital (n=197). Twenty-four hour urine protein was measured by
               two different assays [benzethonium chloride assay (BCA) and
               Bradford assay]. The differences between the two assays were
               calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.
               Commonly used thresholds for defining preeclampsia (0.3 and 0.5
               g/24 hours) were explored for both assays for the prediction of
               adverse clinical outcomes (severe hypertension, Birthweight300
               mg/24 hour proteinuria and, hence, the prevalence of
               preeclampsia differed between the two assays. ROC curve analysis
               demonstrates that the two assays are similar in terms of overall
               performance as predictive tests. However the threshold of 300
               mg/24 hours performs poorly as a predictor of clinical risk.
               Likelihood ratios (LR) for the BCA at the 300 mg/L threshold for
               each clinical outcome do not achieve statistical significance.
               At the 500 mg/L threshold, the LR+for the BCA assay does achieve
               statistical significance for severe hypertension (LR+:1.51 95\%
               CI 0.99-2.28) and for birthweightor=0.5 g/24 hours) and there is

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE: To assess how urine concentration and biochemical
               assay influence the assessment of proteinuria. METHODS: This was
               a prospective study to assess the accuracy of detection and
               quantification of proteinuria within the day assessment unit and
               antenatal ward of a teaching hospital in Leicester, United
               Kingdom. We studied hypertensive pregnancies (of mixed parity)
               referred to day care assessment or attending the antenatal
               hypertension clinic after 20 completed weeks of gestation (n =
               197). Aliquots of a well-mixed 24-h urine collection were tested
               by routine dipstick urinalysis and then assayed for protein
               using the Benzethonium Chloride and the Bradford assays (n =
               197). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total protein excretion in 24 h and
               protein concentration per liter of urine for both biochemical
               assays were compared to semiquantitative dipstick protein
               measurement. RESULTS: The prevalence of proteinuria in the study
               group varied according to the method used for testing. Dipstick
               urinalysis recorded the lowest prevalence (16.2\%) and the
               Benzethonium Chloride assay measuring total protein excretion in
               24 h recorded the highest (70.1\%). When the positive and
               negative predictive values for dipstick urinalysis were
               calculated, performance was found to be dependent on both the
               units of measurement compared and the type of assay used as the
               ``gold standard.'' Positive predictive values ranged from 87.5\%
               to 96.9\% and negative predictive values ranged from 35.2\% to
               92.1\%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of proteinuria in
               hypertensive pregnancies is dependent on the method used to
               detect it. The amount of protein assessed quantitatively is
               further dependent on the biochemical assay employed. However,
               regardless of the quantitative assessment, dipstick urinalysis
               has a significant false-negative rate. This first reporting of a
               variation in performance between dipstick urinalysis and two
               different biochemical assays in pregnancy may be explained in
               relation to protein assay specificity and the observed protein
               compositions of the samples on electrophoretic analysis. The
               significance of proteinuria should be considered in light of the
               method used to detect it, but, ultimately, it must be related to
               clinical outcome.},
