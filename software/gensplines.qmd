title: "gensplines"
---

The `genplines` command calculates various types of spline basis functions. 
This includes splines based on truncated powers, restricted cubic splines, B-splines, M-splines, I-splines and, natural splines.
Note that natural splines and restricted splines are two different ways to impose linearity constraints beyond the boundary knots and will result in the same fitted values in a regression model (with the same knots).

For the most part the methods are the same as those implemented in the `spline2` package in R.
