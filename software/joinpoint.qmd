The `joinpoint` command fits joinpoint models.
These models summarise trends using linear splines where the number and locations of knots are derived through a model fitting algorithm.  
The models are usually used to summarise temporal trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates.

`joinpoint` fits similar models to the the [joinpoint software](https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/) developed by the Surveillance Research Program , National Cancer Institute.

`joinpoint` will select a model using different model selection methods. All possible combinations of models are fitted for a maxiumum number of knots and based on some restrictions on the minimum number of data points between knots and before the first knot and after the last knot.
