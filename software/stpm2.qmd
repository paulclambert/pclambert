`stpm2` fits flexible parametric survival models. 
These pages are rather old and will not be updated. 
I recommend you look at [`stpm3'](stpm3.qmd)

## Examples

### Proportional hazards models
 - [Comparison with a Cox model](stpm2/comparewithcox.qmd)
 - [Predicting hazard and survival functions (use of the `timevar()` option)](stpm2/stpm2_timevar.qmd)
 - [Sensitivity analysis for the number of knots](stpm2/sensitivity_analysis.qmd)
 - [The default knot positions - are they sensible?](stpm2/knot_positions_sensitivity.qmd)
 - [Out of sample predictions (by Sarah Booth)](stpm2/out_of_sample_predictions.qmd)

### Prognostic Models
